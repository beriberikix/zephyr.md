# atmel,sam-i2c-twim

Vendor: [Atmel Corporation](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-atmel)

## Description

These nodes are “i2c” bus nodes.

```text
Atmel SAM4L Family I2C (TWIM) node

The Atmel Two-wire Master Interface (TWIM) interconnects components on a
unique two-wire bus, made up of one clock line and one data line with speeds
of up to 3.4 Mbit/s, based on a byte-oriented transfer format.  The TWIM is
always a bus master and can transfer sequential or single bytes.  Multiple
master capability is supported.  Arbitration of the bus is performed
internally and relinquishes the bus automatically if the bus arbitration is
lost.

When using speeds above standard mode, user may need adjust clock and data
lines slew and strength parameters.  In general, slew 0 and minimal strength
is enough for short buses and light loads.  As a reference, the below
is the lowest power configuration:

  std-clk-slew-lim = <0>;
  std-clk-strength-low = "0.5";
  std-data-slew-lim = <0>;
  std-data-strength-low = "0.5";

  hs-clk-slew-lim = <0>;
  hs-clk-strength-high = "0.5";
  hs-clk-strength-low = "0.5";
  hs-data-slew-lim = <0>;
  hs-data-strength-low = "0.5";

For best performances, user can tune the slope curves using an osciloscope.
The tuning should be performed by groups defined <mode>-<line>.  The prefix
std-<line> configures fast/fast-plus mode speeds and hs-<line> selects the
high speed mode.  The tune should be performed for both clock and data lines
on both speed modes.
