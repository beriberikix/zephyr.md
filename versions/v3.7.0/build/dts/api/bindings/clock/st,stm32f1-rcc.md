# st,stm32f1-rcc

Vendor: [STMicroelectronics](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-st)

## Description

```text
STM32F1 and STM32F37x Reset and Clock controller node.
Adds the ADC prescaler to the standard generic STM32 RCC.

Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#clock-cells` | `int` | ```text Number of items to expect in a Clock specifier ```  This property is **required**.  Constant value: `2` |
| `clock-frequency` | `int` | ```text default frequency in Hz for clock output ```  This property is **required**. |
| `ahb-prescaler` | `int` | ```text AHB prescaler. Defines actual core clock frequency (HCLK) based on system frequency input. The HCLK clocks CPU, AHB, memories and DMA. ```  This property is **required**.  Legal values: `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `64`, `128`, `256`, `512` |
| `apb1-prescaler` | `int` | This property is **required**.  Legal values: `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, `16` |
| `apb2-prescaler` | `int` | This property is **required**.  Legal values: `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, `16` |
| `undershoot-prevention` | `boolean` | ```text On some parts, it could be required to set up highest core frequencies (>80MHz) in two steps in order to prevent undershoot. This is done by applying an intermediate AHB prescaler before switching System Clock source to PLL. Once done, prescaler is set back to expected value. ``` |
| `adc-prescaler` | `int` | ```text ADC prescaler. Defines ADC core clock frequency based on APB2 frequency input. ```  Legal values: `2`, `4`, `6`, `8` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “st,stm32f1-rcc” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wakeup-source` | `boolean` | ```text Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.  When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
| `power-domain` | `phandle` | ```text Power domain the device belongs to.  The device will be notified when the power domain it belongs to is either suspended or resumed. ``` |
| `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto` | `boolean` | ```text Automatically configure the device for runtime power management after the init function runs. ``` |
| `zephyr,disabling-power-states` | `phandles` | ```text List of power states that will disable this device power. ``` |
| `status` | `string` | ```text indicates the operational status of a device ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text compatible strings ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text register space ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each register space ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text interrupts for device ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text extended interrupt specifier for device ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each interrupt ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text phandle to interrupt controller node ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device (used as device_get_binding() argument) ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information.  This property is **deprecated**. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Clock gate information ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each clock ``` |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text number of address cells in reg property ``` |
