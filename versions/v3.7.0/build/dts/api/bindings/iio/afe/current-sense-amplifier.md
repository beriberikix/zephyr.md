Zephyr. If you are looking for the documentation of previous releases, use

# current-sense-amplifier

Vendor: [Generic or vendor-independent](../../../bindings.md#dt-no-vendor)

## Description

```text
When an io-channel measures the voltage over a current sense amplifier,
the interesting measurement is almost always the current through the
sense resistor, not the voltage over it. This binding describes such a current
sense circuit.

This is based on Linux, documentation:
  https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/afe/current-sense-amplifier.yaml
```

Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sense-resistor-micro-ohms` | `int` | ```text Resistance of the shunt resistor in micro-ohms ```  This property is **required**. |
| `sense-gain-mult` | `int` | ```text Amplifier gain multiplier. The default is <1>. ```  Default value: `1` |
| `sense-gain-div` | `int` | ```text Amplifier gain divider. The default is <1>. ```  Default value: `1` |
| `power-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text Control power to the current amplifier.  If present the corresponding GPIO must be set to an active level to enable the current amplifier. ``` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “current-sense-amplifier” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wakeup-source` | `boolean` | ```text Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.  When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
| `power-domain` | `phandle` | ```text Power domain the device belongs to.  The device will be notified when the power domain it belongs to is either suspended or resumed. ``` |
| `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto` | `boolean` | ```text Automatically configure the device for runtime power management after the init function runs. ``` |
| `zephyr,disabling-power-states` | `phandles` | ```text List of power states that will disable this device power. ``` |
| `status` | `string` | ```text indicates the operational status of a device ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text compatible strings ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text register space ```  See [Important properties](../../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each register space ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text interrupts for device ```  See [Important properties](../../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text extended interrupt specifier for device ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each interrupt ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text phandle to interrupt controller node ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device (used as device_get_binding() argument) ```  See [Important properties](../../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information.  This property is **deprecated**. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Clock gate information ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each clock ``` |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text number of address cells in reg property ``` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text number of size cells in reg property ``` |
| `dmas` | `phandle-array` | ```text DMA channels specifiers ``` |
| `dma-names` | `string-array` | ```text Provided names of DMA channel specifiers ``` |
| `io-channels` | `phandle-array` | ```text Channels available with this divider configuration. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `io-channel-names` | `string-array` | ```text Provided names of IO channel specifiers ``` |
| `mboxes` | `phandle-array` | ```text mailbox / IPM channels specifiers ``` |
| `mbox-names` | `string-array` | ```text Provided names of mailbox / IPM channel specifiers ``` |
| `zephyr,deferred-init` | `boolean` | ```text Do not initialize device automatically on boot. Device should be manually initialized using device_init(). ``` |
