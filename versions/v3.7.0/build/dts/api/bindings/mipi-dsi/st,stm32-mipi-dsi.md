| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `phy-clock` | `int` | ```text MIPI PHY clock frequency. Should be set to ensure clock frequency is at least (pixel clock * bits per output pixel) / number of mipi data lanes ``` |
| `resets` | `phandle-array` | ```text Reset information ```  This property is **required**. |
| `reset-names` | `string-array` | ```text Name of each reset ``` |

| `de-active-high` | `boolean` | ```text DSI host data enable is active high. ``` |
| `loosely-packed` | `boolean` | ```text Enable or disable loosely packed stream (needed only when using 18-bit configuration). ``` |
| `largest-packet-size` | `int` | ```text The size, in bytes, of the low power largest packet that can fit in a line during VSA, VBP, VFP and VACT regions ``` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “st,stm32-mipi-dsi” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wakeup-source` | `boolean` | ```text Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.  When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
| `power-domain` | `phandle` | ```text Power domain the device belongs to.  The device will be notified when the power domain it belongs to is either suspended or resumed. ``` |
| `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto` | `boolean` | ```text Automatically configure the device for runtime power management after the init function runs. ``` |
| `zephyr,disabling-power-states` | `phandles` | ```text List of power states that will disable this device power. ``` |
| `status` | `string` | ```text indicates the operational status of a device ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text compatible strings ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text register space ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each register space ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text interrupts for device ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text extended interrupt specifier for device ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each interrupt ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text phandle to interrupt controller node ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device (used as device_get_binding() argument) ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information.  This property is **deprecated**. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Clock gate information ```  This property is **required**. |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text "dsiclk" DSI clock enable. "refclk" External crystal or oscillator clock. "pixelclk" LTDC pixel clock. "refclk" and "pixelclk" are only used to retrieve the frequency for timing calculation. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text number of address cells in reg property ```  This property is **required**.  Constant value: `1` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text number of size cells in reg property ```  This property is **required**. |
| `dmas` | `phandle-array` | ```text DMA channels specifiers ``` |
