This is the documentation for the latest (main) development branch of
Zephyr. If you are looking for the documentation of previous releases, use
the drop-down list at the bottom of the left panel and select the desired version.

A debug probe is used for both flashing and debugging the board. This board has
an [LPC-LINK2 Onboard Debug Probe](../../../develop/flash_debug/probes.md#lpc-link2-onboard-debug-probe). The default firmware present on this
probe is the [LPC-Link2 DAPLink Onboard Debug Probe](../../../develop/flash_debug/probes.md#lpclink2-daplink-onboard-debug-probe).

Based on the host tool installed, please use the following instructions
to setup your debug probe:

- [J-Link Debug Host Tools](../../../develop/flash_debug/host-tools.md#jlink-debug-host-tools):
  [Using J-Link with LPC-Link2 Probe](#using-j-link-with-lpc-link2-probe)
- [LinkServer Debug Host Tools](../../../develop/flash_debug/host-tools.md#linkserver-debug-host-tools):
  [Using CMSIS-DAP with LPC-Link2 Probe](#using-cmsis-dap-with-lpc-link2-probe)
- [pyOCD Debug Host Tools](../../../develop/flash_debug/host-tools.md#pyocd-debug-host-tools):
  [Using CMSIS-DAP with LPC-Link2 Probe](#using-cmsis-dap-with-lpc-link2-probe)

# Using CMSIS-DAP with LPC-Link2 Probe

1. Follow the instructions provided at
   [LPC-LINK2 CMSIS DAP Onboard Debug Probe](../../../develop/flash_debug/probes.md#lpclink2-cmsis-onboard-debug-probe) to reprogram the default debug
   probe firmware on this board.
2. Ensure the SWD isolation jumpers are populated

# Using J-Link with LPC-Link2 Probe

There are two options: the onboard debug circuit can be updated with Segger
J-Link firmware, or a [J-Link External Debug Probe](../../../develop/flash_debug/probes.md#jlink-external-debug-probe) can be attached to the
EVK.

To update the onboard debug circuit, please do the following:

1. Switch the power source for the EVK to a different source than the
   debug USB, as the J-Link firmware does not power the EVK via the
   debug USB.
2. Follow the instructions provided at
   [LPC-Link2 J-Link Onboard Debug Probe](../../../develop/flash_debug/probes.md#lpclink2-jlink-onboard-debug-probe) to reprogram the default debug
   probe firmware on this board.
3. Ensure the SWD isolation jumpers are populated.

To attach an external J-Link probe, ensure the SWD isolation jumpers are
removed, then connect the probe to the external JTAG/SWD header
