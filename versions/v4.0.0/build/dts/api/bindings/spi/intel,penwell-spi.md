# intel,penwell-spi

Vendor: [Intel Corporation](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-intel)

Note

An implementation of a driver matching this compatible is available in
[drivers/spi/spi\_pw.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/drivers/spi/spi_pw.c).

## Description

These nodes are “spi” bus nodes.

Intel Penwell SPI

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cs-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text An array of chip select GPIOs to use. Each element in the array specifies a GPIO. The index in the array corresponds to the child node that the CS gpio controls.  Example:    spi@... {           cs-gpios = <&gpio0 23 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>,                         <&gpio1 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>,                         ...;            spi-device@0 {                   reg = <0>;                   ...           };           spi-device@1 {                   reg = <1>;                   ...           };           ...   };  The child node "spi-device@0" specifies a SPI device with chip select controller gpio0, pin 23, and devicetree GPIO flags GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW. Similarly, "spi-device@1" has CS GPIO controller gpio1, pin 10, and flags GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW. Additional devices can be configured in the same way.  If unsure about the flags cell, GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW is generally a safe choice for a typical "CSn" pin. GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH may be used if intervening hardware inverts the signal to the peripheral device or the line itself is active high.  If this property is not defined, no chip select GPIOs are set. SPI controllers with dedicated CS pins do not need to define the cs-gpios property. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `pw,cs-mode` | `int` | ```text Chip select configuration. possible values: 0: Hardware 1: Software 2: GPIO ```  This property is **required**. |
| `pw,cs-output` | `int` | ```text Use GSPI chip select CS0 or CS1. GSPI 0, 1 & 2 instance supports both chip selects. It can be configured with this DTS property. By default, CS0 is set. Chip select output possible values: 0: CS0 1: CS1 ```  This property is **required**. |
| `pw,fifo-depth` | `int` | ```text SPI controller with embedded Tx and Rx FIFOs. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `clock-frequency` | `int` | ```text Clock frequency the SPI peripheral is being driven at, in Hz. ``` |
| `overrun-character` | `int` | ```text The overrun character (ORC) is used when all bytes from the TX buffer are sent, but the transfer continues due to RX. ``` |
| `vendor-id` | `int` | ```text Vendor ID of the device ``` |
| `device-id` | `int` | ```text Device ID of the device ``` |
| `class-rev` | `int` | ```text Optional class/revision register filter ``` |
| `class-rev-mask` | `int` | ```text Class/revision register mask ``` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “intel,penwell-spi” compatible.

| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text number of size cells in reg property ```  This property is **required**. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text indicates the operational status of a device ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |

| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each interrupt ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text phandle to interrupt controller node ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device (used as device_get_binding() argument) ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information.  This property is **deprecated**. |

When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |

| `zephyr,disabling-power-states` | `phandles` | ```text List of power states that will disable this device power. ``` |
