# fsl,imx27-pwm

Vendor: [Freescale Semiconductor](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-fsl)

Note

An implementation of a driver matching this compatible is available in
[drivers/pwm/pwm\_imx.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/drivers/pwm/pwm_imx.c).

## Description

```text
This driver supports both i.MX6SX and i.MX7D PWM.
The compatible string is named "imx27" because the hardware module is the
same module present starting from imx27 CPUs and this driver can potentially
support other CPUs with imx27 module. This is also the same string used
in the Linux kernel.
```

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prescaler` | `int` | ```text Set the PWM prescale between 0 and 4096 ```  This property is **required**. |
| `#pwm-cells` | `int` | ```text Number of items to expect in a pwm specifier ```  This property is **required**.  Constant value: `2` |
| `pinctrl-0` | `phandles` | ```text Pin configuration/s for the first state. Content is specific to the selected pin controller driver implementation. ``` |
| `pinctrl-1` | `phandles` | ```text Pin configuration/s for the second state. See pinctrl-0. ``` |
| `pinctrl-2` | `phandles` | ```text Pin configuration/s for the third state. See pinctrl-0. ``` |

| `pinctrl-names` | `string-array` | ```text Names for the provided states. The number of names needs to match the number of states. ``` |
| `rdc` | `int` | ```text Set the RDC permission for specified peripheral: Resource Domain Controller (RDC) supports flexible configuration on IP’s access permission, each individual IP can, for example, be configured as A-core only or M-core only. This property uses some macros defined in 'include/zephyr/dt-bindings/rdc/imx_rdc.h' to configure current peripheral's access permission. For example to allow both A53 and M7 Core to have read/write permission to current peripheral: rdc = <(RDC_DOMAIN_PERM(A53_DOMAIN_ID, RDC_DOMAIN_PERM_RW)|\         RDC_DOMAIN_PERM(M7_DOMAIN_ID, RDC_DOMAIN_PERM_RW))>; ``` |
