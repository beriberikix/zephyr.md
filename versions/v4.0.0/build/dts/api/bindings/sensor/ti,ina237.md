# ti,ina237 (on i2c bus)

Vendor: [Texas Instruments](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-ti)

Note

An implementation of a driver matching this compatible is available in
[drivers/sensor/ti/ina23x/ina237.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/drivers/sensor/ti/ina23x/ina237.c).

## Description

```text
TI INA237 Bidirectional Current and Power Monitor.
The <zephyr/dt-bindings/sensor/ina237.h> file should be included in the
DeviceTree and it provides macros that can be used for initializing the
configuration registers.
```

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alert-config` | `int` | ```text Diag alert register, default matches the power-on reset value ``` |
| `adc-mode` | `string` | ```text ADC channel conversion configuration. Default is the power-on reset value. ```  Default value: `Temperature, bus, and shunt voltage continuous`  Legal values: `'Shutdown single shot'`, `'Bus Voltage single shot'`, `'Shunt Voltage single shot'`, `'Bus and Shunt Voltage single shot'`, `'Temperature Single shot'`, `'Temperature and bus voltage single shot'`, `'Temperature and shunt voltage single shot'`, `'Temperature, bus, and shunt voltage single shot'`, `'Shutdown continuous'`, `'Bus voltage continuous'`, `'Shunt voltage continuous'`, `'Bus and shunt voltage continuous'`, `'Temperature continuous'`, `'Temperature and bus voltage continuous'`, `'Temperature and shunt voltage continuous'`, `'Temperature, bus, and shunt voltage continuous'` |
| `vbus-conversion-time-us` | `int` | ```text Vbus conversion time in microseconds. Default is the power-on reset value. ```  Default value: `1052`  Legal values: `50`, `84`, `150`, `280`, `540`, `1052`, `2074`, `4120` |
| `vshunt-conversion-time-us` | `int` | ```text Vshunt conversion time in microseconds. Default is the power-on reset value. ```  Default value: `1052`  Legal values: `50`, `84`, `150`, `280`, `540`, `1052`, `2074`, `4120` |
| `temp-conversion-time-us` | `int` | ```text Temperature conversion time in microseconds. Default is the power-on reset value. ```  Default value: `1052`  Legal values: `50`, `84`, `150`, `280`, `540`, `1052`, `2074`, `4120` |
| `avg-count` | `int` | ```text Number of samples to average (applies to all inputs). Default is the power-on reset value. ```  Default value: `1`  Legal values: `1`, `4`, `16`, `64`, `128`, `256`, `512`, `1024` |
| `high-precision` | `boolean` | ```text Enable high precision mode (4x the resolution). ``` |
| `current-lsb-microamps` | `int` | ```text This value should be selected so that measurement resolution is maximized, that is:    current-lsb(A) = maximum expected current(A) / 2^15  (sensor has 15 bits). For example, if maximum expected current is 15A:    current-lsb(A) = 15A / 2^15 ~= 457uA  Rounded values may be used for convenience, e.g. 500uA/LSB or 1mA/LSB while keeping a good measurement resolution. The units are in uA/LSB so that low maximum currents can be measured with enough resolution. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `rshunt-micro-ohms` | `int` | ```text Shunt resistor value in microOhms ```  This property is **required**. |
| `alert-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text Alert pin ``` |
| `friendly-name` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the sensor. It can be used to distinguish multiple instances of the same model (e.g., lid accelerometer vs. base accelerometer in a laptop) to a host operating system.  This property is defined in the Generic Sensor Property Usages of the HID Usage Tables specification (https://usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_3_0.pdf, section 22.5). ``` |
| `supply-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text GPIO specifier that controls power to the device.  This property should be provided when the device has a dedicated switch that controls power to the device.  The supply state is entirely the responsibility of the device driver.  Contrast with vin-supply. ``` |
| `vin-supply` | `phandle` | ```text Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device. The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.  This property should be provided when device power is supplied by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the request status of all devices fed by the regulator.  Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an inactive state before releasing the regulator. ``` |

| `adc-config` | `int` | ```text Value of the ADC configuration register (ADC conversion times, averaging, operating mode and etc).  Deprecated, please use new properties instead. ``` |
