Node specific propertiesDeprecated node specific propertiesBase properties

Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oscillator-freq` | `int` | ```text Front clock divider / oscillator frequency ```  This property is **required**. |
| `display-offset` | `int` | ```text Vertical offset by com from 0 ~ 127 ```  This property is **required**. |
| `start-line` | `int` | ```text Start line of display RAM to be displayed by selecting a value from 0 to 127 ```  This property is **required**. |
| `multiplex-ratio` | `int` | ```text Multiplex ratio from 16MUX to 128MUX ```  This property is **required**. |
| `prechargep` | `int` | ```text Pre-charge period ranging from 0 to 15 DCLK's ```  This property is **required**. |
| `remap-value` | `int` | ```text Remap register Has multiple configurations (see each bit setting in the datasheet) - Column Address Remapping (A[0]) - Nibble Remapping (A[1]) - Address increment mode (A[2]) - COM Remapping (A[4]) - Splitting of Odd / Even COM Signals (A[6]) ```  This property is **required**. |
| `inversion-on` | `boolean` | ```text Turn on display color inverting ``` |
| `duplex` | `int` | ```text SPI Duplex mode, full or half. By default it's always full duplex thus 0 as this is, by far, the most common mode. Selecting half duplex allows to use SPI MOSI as a bidirectional line, typically used when only one data line is connected. Use the macros not the actual enum value, here is the concordance list (see dt-bindings/spi/spi.h)   0    SPI_FULL_DUPLEX   2048 SPI_HALF_DUPLEX ``` |
| `mipi-cpol` | `boolean` | ```text SPI clock polarity which indicates the clock idle state. If it is used, the clock idle state is logic high; otherwise, low. ``` |
| `mipi-cpha` | `boolean` | ```text SPI clock phase that indicates on which edge data is sampled. If it is used, data is sampled on the second edge; otherwise, on the first edge. ``` |
| `mipi-hold-cs` | `boolean` | ```text In some cases, it is necessary for the master to manage SPI chip select under software control, so that multiple spi transactions can be performed without releasing it. A typical use case is variable length SPI packets where the first spi transaction reads the length and the second spi transaction reads length bytes. ``` |
| `mipi-max-frequency` | `int` | ```text Maximum clock frequency of device's MIPI interface in Hz ``` |
| `mipi-mode` | `int` | ```text MIPI DBI mode in use. Use the macros, not the actual enum value. Here is the concordance list (see dt-bindings/mipi_dbi/mipi_dbi.h)   1     MIPI_DBI_MODE_SPI_3WIRE   2     MIPI_DBI_MODE_SPI_4WIRE   3     MIPI_DBI_MODE_6800_BUS_16_BIT   4     MIPI_DBI_MODE_6800_BUS_9_BIT   5     MIPI_DBI_MODE_6800_BUS_8_BIT   6     MIPI_DBI_MODE_8080_BUS_16_BIT   7     MIPI_DBI_MODE_8080_BUS_9_BIT   8     MIPI_DBI_MODE_8080_BUS_8_BIT ```  Legal values: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8` |
| `supply-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text GPIO specifier that controls power to the device.  This property should be provided when the device has a dedicated switch that controls power to the device.  The supply state is entirely the responsibility of the device driver.  Contrast with vin-supply. ``` |
| `vin-supply` | `phandle` | ```text Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device. The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.  This property should be provided when device power is supplied by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the request status of all devices fed by the regulator.  Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an inactive state before releasing the regulator. ``` |
| `height` | `int` | ```text Height of the panel driven by the controller, with the units in pixels. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `width` | `int` | ```text Width of the panel driven by the controller, with the units in pixels. ```  This property is **required**. |

When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.
