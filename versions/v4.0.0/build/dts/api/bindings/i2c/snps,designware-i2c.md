# snps,designware-i2c

Vendor: [Synopsys, Inc.](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-snps)

Note

An implementation of a driver matching this compatible is available in
[drivers/i2c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/drivers/i2c).

## Description

These nodes are “i2c” bus nodes.

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “snps,designware-i2c” compatible.
