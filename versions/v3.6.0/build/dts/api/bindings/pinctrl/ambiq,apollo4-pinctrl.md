# ambiq,apollo4-pinctrl

Vendor: [Ambiq Micro, Inc.](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-ambiq)

## Description

```text
The Ambiq Apollo4 pin controller is a node responsible for controlling
pin function selection and pin properties, such as routing a UART0 TX
to pin 60 and enabling the pullup resistor on that pin.

The node has the 'pinctrl' node label set in your SoC's devicetree,
so you can modify it like this:

  &pinctrl {
          /* your modifications go here */
  };

All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the
'pinctrl' node, as shown in this example:

  /* You can put this in places like a board-pinctrl.dtsi file in
   * your board directory, or a devicetree overlay in your application.
   */

  /* include pre-defined combinations for the SoC variant used by the board */
  #include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/ambiq-apollo4-pinctrl.h>

  &pinctrl {
    uart0_default: uart0_default {
      group1 {
        pinmux = <UART0TX_P60>;
      };
      group2 {
        pinmux = <UART0RX_P47>;
        input-enable;
      };
    };
  };

The 'uart0_default' child node encodes the pin configurations for a
particular state of a device; in this case, the default (that is, active)
state.

As shown, pin configurations are organized in groups within each child node.
Each group can specify a list of pin function selections in the 'pinmux'
property.

A group can also specify shared pin properties common to all the specified
pins, such as the 'input-enable' property in group 2.

## Properties

### Top level properties

These property descriptions apply to “ambiq,apollo4-pinctrl”
nodes themselves. This page also describes child node
properties in the following sections.

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “ambiq,apollo4-pinctrl” compatible.
