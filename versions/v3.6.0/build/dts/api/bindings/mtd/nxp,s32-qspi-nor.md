| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `has-32k-erase` | `boolean` | ```text Set if the memory device supports 32 KiBy block erase operation. ``` |
| `readoc` | `string` | ```text Specify the number of data lines and opcode used for reading. If not provided, 1-1-1 will be selected. ```  Legal values: `'1-1-1'`, `'1-1-2'`, `'1-2-2'`, `'1-1-4'`, `'1-4-4'` |
| `writeoc` | `string` | ```text Specify the number of data lines and opcode used for writing. If not provided, 1-1-1 will be selected. ```  Legal values: `'1-1-1'`, `'1-1-2'`, `'1-1-4'`, `'1-4-4'` |
| `memory-alignment` | `int` | ```text Memory alignment in bytes, used to calculate padding when performing unaligned accesses. If not provided, 1 byte alignment will be selected. ``` |
| `jedec-id` | `uint8-array` | ```text JEDEC ID as manufacturer ID, memory type, memory density ``` |
| `size` | `int` | ```text flash capacity in bits ``` |
| `sfdp-bfp` | `uint8-array` | ```text Contains the 32-bit words in little-endian byte order from the JESD216 Serial Flash Discoverable Parameters Basic Flash Parameters table.  This provides flash-specific configuration information in cases were runtime retrieval of SFDP data is not desired. ``` |
| `quad-enable-requirements` | `string` | ```text Quad Enable Requirements value from JESD216 BFP DW15.  Use NONE if the device detects 1-1-4 and 1-4-4 modes by the instruction.  Use S1B6 if QE is bit 6 of the first status register byte, and can be configured by reading then writing one byte with RDSR and WRSR.  For other fields see the specification. ```  Legal values: `'NONE'`, `'S2B1v1'`, `'S1B6'`, `'S2B7'`, `'S2B1v4'`, `'S2B1v5'`, `'S2B1v6'` |
| `enter-4byte-addr` | `int` | ```text Enter 4-Byte Addressing value from JESD216 BFP DW16  This property is ignored if the device is configured to use SFDP data from the sfdp-bfp property (CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_DEVICETREE) or to read SFDP properties at runtime (CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_RUNTIME).  For CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_MINIMAL this is the 8-bit value from bits 31:24 of DW16 identifying ways a device can be placed into 4-byte addressing mode.  If provided as a non-zero value the driver assumes that 4-byte addressing is require to access the full address range, and automatically puts the device into 4-byte address mode when the device is initialized. ``` |
| `page-size` | `int` | ```text Number of bytes in a page from JESD216 BFP DW11  This property is only used in the CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_MINIMAL configuration. It is ignored if the device is configured to use SFDP data from the sfdp-bfp property (CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_DEVICETREE) or if the SFDP parameters are read from the device at runtime (CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_RUNTIME).  The default value is 256 bytes if the value is not specified. ``` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “nxp,s32-qspi-nor” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text register space ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text indicates the operational status of a device ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text compatible strings ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each register space ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text interrupts for device ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text extended interrupt specifier for device ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each interrupt ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text phandle to interrupt controller node ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device (used as device_get_binding() argument) ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information.  This property is **deprecated**. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Clock gate information ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each clock ``` |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text number of address cells in reg property ``` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text number of size cells in reg property ``` |
| `dmas` | `phandle-array` | ```text DMA channels specifiers ``` |
| `dma-names` | `string-array` | ```text Provided names of DMA channel specifiers ``` |
| `io-channels` | `phandle-array` | ```text IO channels specifiers ``` |
| `io-channel-names` | `string-array` | ```text Provided names of IO channel specifiers ``` |
| `mboxes` | `phandle-array` | ```text mailbox / IPM channels specifiers ``` |
| `mbox-names` | `string-array` | ```text Provided names of mailbox / IPM channel specifiers ``` |
| `wakeup-source` | `boolean` | ```text Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.  When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
| `power-domain` | `phandle` | ```text Power domain the device belongs to.  The device will be notified when the power domain it belongs to is either suspended or resumed. ``` |
| `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto` | `boolean` | ```text Automatically configure the device for runtime power management after the init function runs. ``` |
