# atmel,sam-pmc

Vendor: [Atmel Corporation](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-atmel)

## Description

```text
Atmel Power Management Controller (PMC)

The Power Management Controller (PMC) optimizes power consumption by
controlling all system and user peripheral clocks. The PMC enables/disables
the clock inputs to many of the peripherals and the processor.

To specify the clocks in a peripheral, the standard clocks property needs
to be used, e.g.:

  uart: uart@xxx {
    ...
    clocks = <&pmc PMC_TYPE_PERIPHERAL p-id>;
    ...
  };

In this example the clock-type was defined as PMC_TYPE_PERIPHERAL and the
peripheral-id was defined as p-id. The p-id number should be consulted on
datasheet, usually it is available at Product Mapping figure.

NOTE: The predefined clock type cell is defined at
include/zephyr/drivers/clock_clontrol/atmel_sam_pmc.h header file.

The clock-type constants are:
  PMC_TYPE_CORE
  PMC_TYPE_SYSTEM
  PMC_TYPE_PERIPHERAL
  PMC_TYPE_GCK
  PMC_TYPE_PROGRAMMABLE
```

## Properties

Node specific propertiesDeprecated node specific propertiesBase properties

Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#clock-cells` | `int` | ```text from common clock binding; shall be set to 2. The first entry is the type of the clock (core, system, peripheral or generated) and the second entry it's the peripheral identification index as provided by the datasheet. ```  This property is **required**.  Constant value: `2` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “atmel,sam-pmc” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text register space ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text indicates the operational status of a device ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text compatible strings ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each register space ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text interrupts for device ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text extended interrupt specifier for device ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each interrupt ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text phandle to interrupt controller node ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device (used as device_get_binding() argument) ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information.  This property is **deprecated**. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Clock gate information ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each clock ``` |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text number of address cells in reg property ``` |

| `mbox-names` | `string-array` | ```text Provided names of mailbox / IPM channel specifiers ``` |
| `wakeup-source` | `boolean` | ```text Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.  When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
| `power-domain` | `phandle` | ```text Power domain the device belongs to.  The device will be notified when the power domain it belongs to is either suspended or resumed. ``` |
| `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto` | `boolean` | ```text Automatically configure the device for runtime power management after the init function runs. ``` |
