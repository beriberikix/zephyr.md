### Supported Features

The Zephyr 96b\_avenger96 board configuration supports the following hardware
features:

| Interface | Controller | Driver/Component |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NVIC | on-chip | nested vector interrupt controller |
| GPIO | on-chip | gpio |
| UART | on-chip | serial port-polling; serial port-interrupt |
| PINMUX | on-chip | pinmux |

The default configuration can be found in the defconfig file:
`boards/arm/96b_avenger96/96b_avenger96_defconfig`

### Connections and IOs

96Boards Avenger96 Board schematic is available here:
[Avenger96 board schematics](https://www.96boards.org/documentation/consumer/avenger96/hardware-docs/files/avenger96-schematics.pdf).

#### Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:

- UART\_7 TX/RX/RTS/CTS : PE8/PE7/PE9/PE10 (UART console)
- UART\_4 TX/RX : PD1/PB2

#### System Clock

The Cortex®-M4 Core is configured to run at a 209 MHz clock speed. This value
must match the configured mlhclk\_ck frequency.

#### Serial Port

96Boards Avenger96 board has 3 U(S)ARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned
by default to the RAM console to be dumped by the Linux Remoteproc Framework
on Cortex®-A7 core. Alternatively, Zephyr console output can be assigned to
UART7 which is disabled by default. UART console can be enabled through
board’s devicetree and 96b\_avenger96\_defconfig board file (or prj.conf
project files), and will disable existing RAM console output. Default UART
console settings are 115200 8N1.

## Programming and Debugging

The STM32MP157A doesn’t have QSPI flash for the Cortex®-M4 and it needs to be
started by the Cortex®-A7 core. The Cortex®-A7 core is responsible to load the
Cortex®-M4 binary application into the RAM, and get the Cortex®-M4 out of reset.
The Cortex®-A7 can perform these steps at bootloader level or after the Linux
system has booted.

The Cortex®-M4 can use up to 2 different RAMs. The program pointer starts at
address 0x00000000 (RETRAM), the vector table should be loaded at this address
These are the memory mappings for Cortex®-A7 and Cortex®-M4:

| Region | Cortex®-A7 | Cortex®-M4 | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RETRAM | 0x38000000-0x3800FFFF | 0x00000000-0x0000FFFF | 64KB |
| MCUSRAM | 0x10000000-0x1005FFFF | 0x10000000-0x1005FFFF | 384KB |
| DDR | 0xC0000000-0xFFFFFFFF |  | up to 1 GB |

Refer to [stm32mp157 boot Cortex-M4 firmware](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/index.php/Linux_remoteproc_framework_overview#How_to_use_the_framework) wiki page for instruction
to load and start the Cortex-M4 firmware.

### Debugging

You can debug an application using OpenOCD and GDB. The Solution proposed below
is based on the Linux STM32MP1 SDK OpenOCD and is available only for a Linux
environment. The firmware must first be loaded by the Cortex®-A7. Developer
then attaches the debugger to the running Zephyr using OpenOCD.

#### Prerequisite

install [stm32mp1 developer package](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/index.php/STM32MP1_Developer_Package#Installing_the_SDK).

1. start OpenOCD in a dedicated terminal

   - Start up the sdk environment:

     ```text
     source <SDK installation directory>/environment-setup-cortexa7hf-neon-vfpv4-openstlinux_weston-linux-gnueabi
     ```
   - Start OpenOCD:

     ```text
     ${OECORE_NATIVE_SYSROOT}/usr/bin/openocd -s ${OECORE_NATIVE_SYSROOT}/usr/share/openocd/scripts -f board/stm32mp15x_ev1_jlink_jtag.cfg
     ```
2. run gdb in Zephyr environment

   ```shell
   # On Linux
   cd $ZEPHYR_BASE/samples/hello_world
   mkdir -p build && cd build

   # Use cmake to configure a Ninja-based build system:
   cmake -GNinja -DBOARD=96b_avenger96 ..

   # Now run ninja on the generated build system:
   ninja debug
   ```
