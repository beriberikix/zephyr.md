Node specific propertiesDeprecated node specific propertiesBase properties

Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `smps-mode` | `string` | ```text SMPS mode selection  OFF:   - SMPS converter disabled   - LDOs supply voltage: VDD  WARNING: The SMPS must not be disabled on board using the 'SMPS supply configuration', so this mode should NEVER be selected on these boards. Only use this mode if your board is using the 'NOSMPS supply configuration'.  Refer to RM0505 §5.5 "SMPS step down regulator" for details.  PRECHARGE: (also called BYPASS)   - SMPS converter enabled - clock disabled   - LDOs supply voltage: VDD (though SMPS)     - Current supplied to LDOs can be limited       (feature only supported on STM32WB05 / STM32WB09)  RUN: (also called ON)   - SMPS converter enabled - clock enabled   - LDOs supply voltage: regulated SMPS output     - Target output voltage can be programmed ```  This property is **required**.  Legal values: `'OFF'`, `'PRECHARGE'`, `'RUN'` |
| `smps-bom` | `int` | ```text SMPS L/C BOM selection  Indicates which L/C BOM is present on the board:   1: 1.5µH inductance, 2.2µF output capacitance   2: 2.2µH inductance, 4.7µF output capacitance   3: 10µH inductance, 4.7µF output capacitance Refer to RM0505 §5.5 for more details about L/C BOM.  This property is required if `smps-mode` is not "OFF". ```  Legal values: `1`, `2`, `3` |
| `smps-clock-prescaler` | `int` | ```text SMPS clock prescaler factor  The SMPS clock, CLK_SMPS, comes from a 16 MHz source that goes through one of two prescalers, with a respective division factor of 2 and 4. This property selects which prescaler should be used.  Setting this property to 2 results in CLK_SMPS = 8 MHz. Setting this property to 4 results in CLK_SMPS = 4 MHz.  All features of the SMPS can be used regardless of which prescaler has been chosen. Since a slower clock results in less power consumption, this property defaults to 4.  This property is only used if `smps-mode` is not "OFF". ```  Default value: `4`  Legal values: `2`, `4` |
| `smps-lp-floating` | `boolean` | ```text Floating SMPS output in low-power state  If this property is set, the SMPS output pin (VFBSD) is left floating when the SoC is in low-power state.  If this property is not set, the SMPS is placed in PRECHARGE mode when the SoC is in low-power state. (i.e., VFBSD voltage is equal to VDD) ``` |
| `smps-current-limit` | `string` | ```text SMPS output current limit (in mA)  The default value of 20 mA corresponds to the maximal output current allowed for the SMPS, and is also equal to the hardware reset configuration.  On STM32WB06 and STM32WB07, this property is ignored as the output current limitation feature is not available.  This property is only used if `smps-mode` is "PRECHARGE". ```  Default value: `20`  Legal values: `'2_5'`, `'5'`, `'10'`, `'20'` |
| `smps-output-voltage` | `string` | ```text SMPS regulated output voltage  The default value corresponds to the hardware reset configuration of 1.40V regulated output.  This property is only used if `smps-mode` is "RUN". ```  Default value: `1V40`  Legal values: `'1V20'`, `'1V25'`, `'1V30'`, `'1V35'`, `'1V40'`, `'1V45'`, `'1V50'`, `'1V55'`, `'1V60'`, `'1V65'`, `'1V70'`, `'1V75'`, `'1V80'`, `'1V85'`, `'1V90'`, `'1V95'` |
| `wkup-pins-nb` | `int` | ```text Max nbr of system wake-up pins. For example wkup-pins-nb = <8>; on the stm32u5 ``` |
| `wkup-pin-srcs` | `int` | ```text Number of wake-up GPIO sources to select from for each wake-up pin. If not specified, that means there is only 1 GPIO source for each wake-up pin.  For example, each wake-up pin on STM32U5 is associated with 4 wake-up sources, 3 of them correspond to GPIOs. ``` |
| `wkup-pins-pol` | `boolean` | ```text True if SoC has a wake-up pins polarity config register ``` |
| `wkup-pins-pupd` | `boolean` | ```text True if SoC has pull-up/down config register(s) for GPIO ports that are associated with wake-up pins. ``` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “st,stm32wb0-pwr” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by address fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Constant value: `1` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by size fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property. For example:    / {        soc {            #address-cells = <1>;            #size-cells = <1>;             uart@1000 {                reg = <0x1000 0x2000>, <0x3000 0x4000>;                reg-names = "foo", "bar";            };        };   };  The uart@1000 node has two register blocks:    - one with base address 0x1000, size 0x2000, and name "foo"   - another with base address 0x3000, size 0x4000, and name "bar" ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device.

| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text If present, this refers to the node which handles interrupts generated by this device.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.  For details, see "4.1.2 Miscellaneous Properties" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each clock provider in the "clocks" property. ``` |

When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
| `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto` | `boolean` | ```text Automatically configure the device for runtime power management after the init function runs. ``` |
| `zephyr,disabling-power-states` | `phandles` | ```text List of power states that will disable this device power. ``` |
