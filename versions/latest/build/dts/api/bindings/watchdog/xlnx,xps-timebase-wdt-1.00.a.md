(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “xlnx,xps-timebase-wdt-1.00.a” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |

| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Reference to AXI clock for watchdog core ```  This property is **required**. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text indicates the operational status of a device ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text compatible strings ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each register space ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text interrupts for device ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |

| `wakeup-source` | `boolean` | ```text Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.  When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
| `power-domain` | `phandle` | ```text Power domain the device belongs to.  The device will be notified when the power domain it belongs to is either suspended or resumed. ``` |
