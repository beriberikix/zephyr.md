# st,stm32-dma

Vendor: [STMicroelectronics](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-st)

## Description

These nodes are “dma” bus nodes.

```text
STM32 DMA controller

The STM32 DMA is a general-purpose direct memory access controller
capable of supporting 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 independent DMA channels.
Each stm32 soc with a DMA is of a special version type, which could be
V1 like stm32F4 or stm32F2 socs, they include FIFO control registers
or V2 like stm32L4 soc or stm322WB, some also have DMAMUX controller
or V2bis like stm32F1 or stm32L1, where requests are multiplexed
```

Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `st,mem2mem` | `boolean` | ```text If the DMA controller V1 supports memory to memory transfer ``` |
| `dma-offset` | `int` | ```text offset in the table of channels when mapping to a DMAMUX for 1st dma instance, offset is 0, for 2nd dma instance, offset is the nb of dma channels of the 1st dma, for 3rd dma instance, offset is the nb of dma channels of the 2nd dma plus the nb of dma channels of the 1st dma instance, etc. ``` |
| `#dma-cells` | `int` | ```text Number of items to expect in a DMA specifier ```  This property is **required**. |
| `dma-channel-mask` | `int` | ```text Bitmask of available DMA channels in ascending order that are not reserved by firmware and are available to the kernel. i.e. first channel corresponds to LSB. ``` |
| `dma-channels` | `int` | ```text Number of DMA channels supported by the controller ``` |
| `dma-requests` | `int` | ```text Number of DMA request signals supported by the controller. ``` |
| `dma-buf-addr-alignment` | `int` | ```text Memory address alignment requirement for DMA buffers used by the controller. ``` |
| `dma-buf-size-alignment` | `int` | ```text Memory size alignment requirement for DMA buffers used by the controller. ``` |
| `dma-copy-alignment` | `int` | ```text Minimal chunk of data possible to be copied by the controller. ``` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “st,stm32-dma” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text register space ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text interrupts for device ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text indicates the operational status of a device ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text compatible strings ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each register space ``` |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text extended interrupt specifier for device ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each interrupt ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text phandle to interrupt controller node ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device (used as device_get_binding() argument) ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information.  This property is **deprecated**. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Clock gate information ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text name of each clock ``` |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text number of address cells in reg property ``` |

| `wakeup-source` | `boolean` | ```text Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.  When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
| `power-domain` | `phandle` | ```text Power domain the device belongs to.  The device will be notified when the power domain it belongs to is either suspended or resumed. ``` |
| `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto` | `boolean` | ```text Automatically configure the device for runtime power management after the init function runs. ``` |
