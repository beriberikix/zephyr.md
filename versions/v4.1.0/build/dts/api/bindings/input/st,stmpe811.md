Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text Interrupt GPIO. Used by the controller to signal touch data is available. Active low. ``` |
| `raw-x-min` | `int` | ```text Signed raw X axis start for scaling the reported coordinates. No effect if screen size is not set. ``` |
| `raw-y-min` | `int` | ```text Signed raw Y axis start for scaling the reported coordinates. No effect if screen size is not set. ``` |
| `raw-x-max` | `int` | ```text Raw X axis end for scaling the reported coordinates. No effect if screen size is not set. ``` |
| `raw-y-max` | `int` | ```text Raw Y axis end for scaling the reported coordinates. No effect if screen size is not set. ``` |
| `panel-driver-settling-time-us` | `int` | ```text Panel driver settling time (microseconds). For large panels (> 6"), a capacitor of 10 nF is recommended at the touchscreen terminals for noise filtering. As a general rule, 1-5 nF capacitors require around 500 us settling time, and 5-10 nF need around 1 ms. When a larger capacitor is used, this value should be changed, as it can lead to inaccuracy of the measurement. ```  This property is **required**.  Legal values: `10`, `100`, `500`, `1000`, `5000`, `10000`, `50000`, `100000` |
| `touch-detect-delay-us` | `int` | ```text Touch detect delay (microseconds) is the delay from the activation of the pull-up resistor in the X+ line to the time the device performs touch detection. If no capacitor, or a smaller capacitor is used, this value can be lowered to minimize detection latency, but it could lower the position stability. ```  This property is **required**.  Legal values: `10`, `50`, `100`, `500`, `1000`, `5000`, `10000`, `50000` |
| `touch-average-control` | `int` | ```text Average control (number of samples). This parameter can be set to any of the possible values. Higher values result in more filtering of noise, but also introduce more latency in the touch detection process.  Use cases that require low touch detection latency may benefit from using a lower value for this parameter, at the cost of less noise filtering. ```  This property is **required**.  Legal values: `1`, `2`, `4`, `8` |
| `tracking-index` | `int` | ```text Tracking index determines the minimal distance between the current touch position and the previous touch position. If the distance is shorter than the tracking index, it is discarded. Lowering the tracking index increases the frequency of touch events, but also increases the load on the system. ```  This property is **required**.  Legal values: `0`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, `92`, `127` |
| `supply-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text GPIO specifier that controls power to the device.  This property should be provided when the device has a dedicated switch that controls power to the device.  The supply state is entirely the responsibility of the device driver.  Contrast with vin-supply. ``` |
| `vin-supply` | `phandle` | ```text Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device. The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.  This property should be provided when device power is supplied by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the request status of all devices fed by the regulator.  Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an inactive state before releasing the regulator. ``` |
| `screen-width` | `int` | ```text Horizontal resolution of touchscreen (maximum x coordinate reported + 1). The default corresponds to a valid value for non-inverted axis, required for a display with an inverted x axis. ``` |
| `screen-height` | `int` | ```text Vertical resolution of touchscreen (maximum y coordinate reported + 1). The default corresponds to a valid value for non-inverted axis, required for a display with an inverted y axis. ``` |
| `inverted-x` | `boolean` | ```text X axis is inverted. ``` |
| `inverted-y` | `boolean` | ```text Y axis is inverted. ``` |
| `swapped-x-y` | `boolean` | ```text X and Y axis are swapped. Swapping is done after inverting the axis. ``` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “st,stmpe811” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text device address on i2c bus ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property.

| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.  For details, see "4.1.2 Miscellaneous Properties" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each clock provider in the "clocks" property. ``` |
