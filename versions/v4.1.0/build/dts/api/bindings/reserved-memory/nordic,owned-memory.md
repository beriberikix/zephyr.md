# nordic,owned-memory

Vendor: [Nordic Semiconductor](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-nordic)

## Description

```text
Nordic Owned Memory

Memory region with permission attributes. Each enabled region of this kind
will be recorded in the UICR of the compiled domain. Memory ownership and
access is then configured for the domain at boot time, based on the UICR.

Example:

  reserved-memory {
      memory@2fc00000 {
          compatible = "nordic,owned-memory";
          reg = <0x2fc00000 0x1000>;
          status = "okay";
          nordic,access = <NRF_OWNER_ID_APPLICATION NRF_PERM_R>,
                          <NRF_OWNER_ID_RADIOCORE NRF_PERM_W>;
      };
  };

A single local domain can request a memory region to be reserved on behalf of
multiple access owners. A single memory region shall be reserved by at most
one domain, by setting status "okay" on the associated node. For example, if
the region defined above is enabled by Application on behalf of Radiocore,
then the Radiocore's devicetree must set status "disabled" on that node.

Each of the different owners may have a different set of permissions granted,
as also shown above.

Note: one domain can also reserve memory for another domain and not itself.
Whichever domain has status "okay" set on the node does not need to be listed
as one of the access owners.

Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nordic,access` | `array` | ```text Array of (owner-id, permission-flags) pairs, where:  - Owner ID represents the domain that will have access to this memory.   Valid values can be found in dts/common/nordic/<soc>.dtsi,   where they are defined as NRF_OWNER_ID_*  - Permissions are encoded as a 32-bit bitfield, using the flags found in   include/zephyr/dt-bindings/reserved-memory/nordic-owned-memory.h,   where they are defined as NRF_PERM_*    The same file defines all possible permission flag combinations.   For example, one can use:     <NRF_OWNER_ID_APPLICATION NRF_PERM_RWX>    as a shorthand for:     <NRF_OWNER_ID_APPLICATION (NRF_PERM_R | NRF_PERM_W | NRF_PERM_X)> ``` |
| `zephyr,memory-region` | `string` | ```text Signify that this node should result in a dedicated linker script memory region in the final executable. The region address and size is taken from the <reg> property, while the name is the value of this property. ``` |
| `zephyr,memory-region-flags` | `string` | ```text Set attributes such as read-only or executable for the linker script memory region. The string set here will be specified in parentheses after the area name in the linker script. ``` |
| `zephyr,memory-attr` | `int` | ```text Attribute or set of attributes (bitmask) for the memory region. See 'include/zephyr/dt-bindings/memory-attr/memory-attr.h' for a comprehensive list with description of possible values. ``` |

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “nordic,owned-memory” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property. For example:    / {        soc {            #address-cells = <1>;            #size-cells = <1>;             uart@1000 {                reg = <0x1000 0x2000>, <0x3000 0x4000>;                reg-names = "foo", "bar";            };        };   };  The uart@1000 node has two register blocks:    - one with base address 0x1000, size 0x2000, and name "foo"   - another with base address 0x3000, size 0x4000, and name "bar" ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device. The interrupts themselves are defined in either "interrupts" or "interrupts-extended" properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text If present, this refers to the node which handles interrupts generated by this device.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.  For details, see "4.1.2 Miscellaneous Properties" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each clock provider in the "clocks" property. ``` |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by address fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by size fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |

| `power-domain-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to the power domain specifiers in the "power-domains" property. ``` |
| `#power-domain-cells` | `int` | ```text Number of cells in power-domains property ``` |
| `zephyr,deferred-init` | `boolean` | ```text Do not initialize device automatically on boot. Device should be manually initialized using device_init(). ``` |
| `wakeup-source` | `boolean` | ```text Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.  When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
| `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto` | `boolean` | ```text Automatically configure the device for runtime power management after the init function runs. ``` |
| `zephyr,disabling-power-states` | `phandles` | ```text List of power states that will disable this device power. ``` |
