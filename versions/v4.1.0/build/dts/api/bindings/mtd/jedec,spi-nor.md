| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wp-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text WPn pin ``` |
| `hold-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text HOLDn pin ``` |
| `reset-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text RESETn pin ``` |
| `spi-max-frequency` | `int` | ```text Maximum clock frequency of device's SPI interface in Hz ```  This property is **required**. |
| `duplex` | `int` | ```text Duplex mode, full or half. By default it's always full duplex thus 0 as this is, by far, the most common mode. Use the macros not the actual enum value, here is the concordance list (see dt-bindings/spi/spi.h)   0    SPI_FULL_DUPLEX   2048 SPI_HALF_DUPLEX ```  Legal values: `0`, `2048` |
| `frame-format` | `int` | ```text Motorola or TI frame format. By default it's always Motorola's, thus 0 as this is, by far, the most common format. Use the macros not the actual enum value, here is the concordance list (see dt-bindings/spi/spi.h)   0     SPI_FRAME_FORMAT_MOTOROLA   32768 SPI_FRAME_FORMAT_TI ```  Legal values: `0`, `32768` |
| `spi-cpol` | `boolean` | ```text SPI clock polarity which indicates the clock idle state. If it is used, the clock idle state is logic high; otherwise, low. ``` |
| `spi-cpha` | `boolean` | ```text SPI clock phase that indicates on which edge data is sampled. If it is used, data is sampled on the second edge; otherwise, on the first edge. ``` |
| `spi-hold-cs` | `boolean` | ```text In some cases, it is necessary for the master to manage SPI chip select under software control, so that multiple spi transactions can be performed without releasing it. A typical use case is variable length SPI packets where the first spi transaction reads the length and the second spi transaction reads length bytes. ``` |
| `supply-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text GPIO specifier that controls power to the device.  This property should be provided when the device has a dedicated switch that controls power to the device.  The supply state is entirely the responsibility of the device driver.  Contrast with vin-supply. ``` |
| `vin-supply` | `phandle` | ```text Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device. The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.  This property should be provided when device power is supplied by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the request status of all devices fed by the regulator.  Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an inactive state before releasing the regulator. ``` |
| `requires-ulbpr` | `boolean` | ```text Indicates the device requires the ULBPR (0x98) command.  Some flash chips such as the Microchip SST26VF series have a block protection register that initializes to write-protected.  Use this property to indicate that the BPR must be unlocked before write operations can proceed. ``` |
| `has-dpd` | `boolean` | ```text Indicates the device supports the DPD (0xB9) command.  Use this property to indicate the flash chip supports the Deep Power-Down mode that is entered by command 0xB9 to reduce power consumption below normal standby levels.  Use of this property implies that the RDPD (0xAB) Release from Deep Power Down command is also supported.  (On some chips this command functions as Read Electronic Signature; see t-enter-dpd). ``` |
| `dpd-wakeup-sequence` | `array` | ```text Specifies wakeup durations for devices without RDPD.  Some devices (Macronix MX25R in particular) wake from deep power down by a timed sequence of CSn toggles rather than the RDPD command.  This property specifies three durations measured in nanoseconds, in this order: (1) tDPDD (Delay Time for Release from Deep Power-Down Mode) (2) tCDRP (CSn Toggling Time before Release from Deep Power-Down Mode) (3) tRDP (Recovery Time for Release from Deep Power-Down Mode)  Absence of this property indicates that the RDPD command should be used to wake the chip from Deep Power-Down mode. ``` |
| `t-enter-dpd` | `int` | ```text Duration required to complete the DPD command.  This provides the duration, in nanoseconds, that CSn must be remain deasserted after issuing DPD before the chip will enter deep power down.  If not provided the driver does not enforce a delay. ``` |
| `t-exit-dpd` | `int` | ```text Duration required to complete the RDPD command.  This provides the duration, in nanoseconds, that CSn must be remain deasserted after issuing RDPD before the chip will exit deep power down and be ready to receive additional commands.  If not provided the driver does not enforce a delay. ``` |
| `has-lock` | `int` | ```text Bit mask of bits of the status register that should be cleared on startup.  Some devices from certain vendors power-up with block protect bits set in the status register, which prevent any erase or program operation from working.  Devices that have this behavior need to clear those bits on startup.  However, other devices have non-volatile bits in the status register that should not be cleared.  This value, when present, identifies bits in the status register that should be cleared when the device is initialized. ``` |
| `mxicy,mx25r-power-mode` | `string` | ```text Select to configure flash to use ultra low power mode or high performance mode (L/H switch). The high performance mode has faster write and erase performance, but use more power than ultra low power mode. Only supported on Macronix MX25R Ultra Low Power series. ```  Legal values: `'low-power'`, `'high-performance'` |
| `use-4b-addr-opcodes` | `boolean` | ```text Indicates the device uses special 4-byte address opcodes. Instead of switching to 4-byte addressing mode, the device uses special opcodes for 4-byte addressing.  Some devices support 4-byte address opcodes for read/write/erase operations.  Use this property to indicate that the device supports 4-byte address opcodes. ``` |
| `jedec-id` | `uint8-array` | ```text JEDEC ID as manufacturer ID, memory type, memory density ``` |
| `size` | `int` | ```text flash capacity in bits ``` |
| `sfdp-bfp` | `uint8-array` | ```text Contains the 32-bit words in little-endian byte order from the JESD216 Serial Flash Discoverable Parameters Basic Flash Parameters table.  This provides flash-specific configuration information in cases were runtime retrieval of SFDP data is not desired. ``` |
| `quad-enable-requirements` | `string` | ```text Quad Enable Requirements value from JESD216 BFP DW15.  Use NONE if the device detects 1-1-4 and 1-4-4 modes by the instruction.  Use S1B6 if QE is bit 6 of the first status register byte, and can be configured by reading then writing one byte with RDSR and WRSR.  For other fields see the specification. ```  Legal values: `'NONE'`, `'S2B1v1'`, `'S1B6'`, `'S2B7'`, `'S2B1v4'`, `'S2B1v5'`, `'S2B1v6'` |
| `enter-4byte-addr` | `int` | ```text Enter 4-Byte Addressing value from JESD216 BFP DW16  This property is ignored if the device is configured to use SFDP data from the sfdp-bfp property (CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_DEVICETREE) or to read SFDP properties at runtime (CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_RUNTIME).  For CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_MINIMAL this is the 8-bit value from bits 31:24 of DW16 identifying ways a device can be placed into 4-byte addressing mode.  If provided as a non-zero value the driver assumes that 4-byte addressing is require to access the full address range, and automatically puts the device into 4-byte address mode when the device is initialized. ``` |
| `page-size` | `int` | ```text Number of bytes in a page from JESD216 BFP DW11  This property is only used in the CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_MINIMAL configuration. It is ignored if the device is configured to use SFDP data from the sfdp-bfp property (CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_DEVICETREE) or if the SFDP parameters are read from the device at runtime (CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_RUNTIME).  The default value is 256 bytes if the value is not specified. ``` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “jedec,spi-nor” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property. For example:    / {        soc {            #address-cells = <1>;            #size-cells = <1>;             uart@1000 {                reg = <0x1000 0x2000>, <0x3000 0x4000>;                reg-names = "foo", "bar";            };        };   };  The uart@1000 node has two register blocks:    - one with base address 0x1000, size 0x2000, and name "foo"   - another with base address 0x3000, size 0x4000, and name "bar" ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device. The interrupts themselves are defined in either "interrupts" or "interrupts-extended" properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |

| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.  For details, see "4.1.2 Miscellaneous Properties" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each clock provider in the "clocks" property. ``` |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by address fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by size fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |

| `wakeup-source` | `boolean` | ```text Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.  When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
