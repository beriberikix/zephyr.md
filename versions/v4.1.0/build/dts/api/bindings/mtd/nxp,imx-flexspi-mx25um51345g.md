| `word-addressable` | `boolean` | ```text Don't transmit the least significant address bit when the flash is word addressable. See the WA field in registers FLASHA1CR0 through FLASHB2CR0. ``` |
| `ahb-write-wait-unit` | `int` | ```text AHB write wait interval units, in AHB clock cycles. See the AWRWAITUNIT field in registers FLASHA1CR2 through FLASHB2CR2. The default corresponds to the reset value of the register field. ```  Default value: `2`  Legal values: `2`, `8`, `32`, `128`, `512`, `2048`, `8192`, `32768` |

| `spi-max-frequency` | `int` | ```text Maximum clock frequency of device's SPI interface in Hz ```  This property is **required**. |
| `duplex` | `int` | ```text Duplex mode, full or half. By default it's always full duplex thus 0 as this is, by far, the most common mode. Use the macros not the actual enum value, here is the concordance list (see dt-bindings/spi/spi.h)   0    SPI_FULL_DUPLEX   2048 SPI_HALF_DUPLEX ```  Legal values: `0`, `2048` |

Contrast with vin-supply. ``` |
| `vin-supply` | `phandle` | ```text Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device. The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.  This property should be provided when device power is supplied by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the request status of all devices fed by the regulator.  Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an inactive state before releasing the regulator. ``` |

For CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_MINIMAL this is the 8-bit value from bits 31:24 of DW16 identifying ways a device can be placed into 4-byte addressing mode.  If provided as a non-zero value the driver assumes that 4-byte addressing is require to access the full address range, and automatically puts the device into 4-byte address mode when the device is initialized. ``` |
| `page-size` | `int` | ```text Number of bytes in a page from JESD216 BFP DW11  This property is only used in the CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_MINIMAL configuration. It is ignored if the device is configured to use SFDP data from the sfdp-bfp property (CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_DEVICETREE) or if the SFDP parameters are read from the device at runtime (CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SFDP_RUNTIME).

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “nxp,imx-flexspi-mx25um51345g” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |

Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property.

| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device.

| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each clock provider in the "clocks" property. ``` |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by address fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by size fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
