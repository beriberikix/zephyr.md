| `xip-config` | `array` | ```text Array of parameters to configure the xip feature. enable: whether XIP feature is enabled. address_offset: The offset in bytes to the start of the                 platform specific XIP address region. size: The size in bytes of the XIP address region one       wish to enable or disable. permission: The permission granted to the region. (RW/RO)  For controller that support this feature. One may map the device memory into Soc system memory map. i.e. XIP address region So that the device may be used as an external RAM and execute code.  default = <   .enable         = false;   .address_offset = 0;   .size           = 0;   .permission     = 0; > ```  Default value: `[0, 0, 0, 0]` |

If both properties are provided then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an inactive state before releasing the regulator. ``` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “zephyr,mspi-emul-device” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property.

| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device.

| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each clock provider in the "clocks" property. ``` |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by address fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by size fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |

| `wakeup-source` | `boolean` | ```text Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.  When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
