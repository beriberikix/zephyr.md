# atmel,sam-i2c-twim

Vendor: [Atmel Corporation](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-atmel)

Note

An implementation of a driver matching this compatible is available in
[drivers/i2c/i2c\_sam4l\_twim.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/drivers/i2c/i2c_sam4l_twim.c).

## Description

These nodes are “i2c” bus nodes.

```text
Atmel SAM4L Family I2C (TWIM)

The Atmel Two-wire Master Interface (TWIM) interconnects components on a
unique two-wire bus, made up of one clock line and one data line with speeds
of up to 3.4 Mbit/s, based on a byte-oriented transfer format.  The TWIM is
always a bus master and can transfer sequential or single bytes.  Multiple
master capability is supported.  Arbitration of the bus is performed
internally and relinquishes the bus automatically if the bus arbitration is
lost.

When using speeds above standard mode, user may need adjust clock and data
lines slew and strength parameters.  In general, slew 0 and minimal strength
is enough for short buses and light loads.  As a reference, the below
is the lowest power configuration:

  std-clk-slew-lim = <0>;
  std-clk-strength-low = "0.5";
  std-data-slew-lim = <0>;
  std-data-strength-low = "0.5";

  hs-clk-slew-lim = <0>;
  hs-clk-strength-high = "0.5";
  hs-clk-strength-low = "0.5";
  hs-data-slew-lim = <0>;
  hs-data-strength-low = "0.5";

For best performances, user can tune the slope curves using an osciloscope.
The tuning should be performed by groups defined <mode>-<line>.  The prefix
std-<line> configures fast/fast-plus mode speeds and hs-<line> selects the
high speed mode.  The tune should be performed for both clock and data lines
on both speed modes.
```

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “atmel,sam-i2c-twim” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ```  This property is **required**. |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by address fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  Constant value: `1` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by size fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
