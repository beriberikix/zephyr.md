# gd,gd32-pinctrl-afio

Vendor: [GigaDevice Semiconductor](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-gd)

## Description

```text
The GD32 pin controller (AFIO model) is a singleton node responsible for
controlling pin function selection and pin properties. For example, you can
use this node to route USART0 RX to pin PA10 and enable the pull-up resistor
on the pin. Remapping is also supported.

The node has the 'pinctrl' node label set in your SoC's devicetree,
so you can modify it like this:

  &pinctrl {
          /* your modifications go here */
  };

All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the
'pinctrl' node, as shown in this example:

  /* You can put this in places like a board-pinctrl.dtsi file in
   * your board directory, or a devicetree overlay in your application.
   */

  /* include pre-defined combinations for the SoC variant used by the board */
  #include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/gd32f403z(k-i-g-e-c-b)xx-pinctrl.h>

  &pinctrl {
    /* configuration for the usart0 "default" state */
    usart0_default: usart0_default {
      /* group 1 */
      group1 {
        /* configure PA9 as USART0 TX and PA11 as USART0 CTS (no remap) */
        pinmux = <USART0_TX_PA9_NORMP>, <USART0_CTS_PA11_NORMP>;
      };
      /* group 2 */
      group2 {
        /* configure PA10 as USART0 RX and PA12 as USART0 RTS (no remap) */
        pinmux = <USART0_RX_PA10_NORMP>, <USART0_RTS_PA12_NORMP>;
        /* both PA10 and PA12 have pull-up enabled */
        bias-pull-up;
      };

    /* configuration for the usart0 "sleep" state */
    usart0_sleep: usart0_sleep {
      /* group 1 */
      group1 {
        /* configure PA9, PA10, PA11 and PA12 in analog mode */
        pinmux = <ANALOG_PA9>, <ANALOG_PA10>, <ANALOG_PA12>, <ANALOG_PA11>;
      };
    };

The 'usart0_default' child node encodes the pin configurations for a
particular state of a device; in this case, the default (that is, active)
state. Similarly, 'usart0_sleep' child node encodes the pin configurations
for the sleep state (used in device low power mode). Note that analog mode
is used for low power states because it disconnects the pin pull-up/down
resistor, schmitt trigger, and output buffer.

As shown, pin configurations are organized in groups within each child node.
Each group can specify a list of pin function selections in the 'pinmux'
property.

A group can also specify shared pin properties common to all the specified
pins, such as the 'bias-pull-up' property in group 2. Here is a list of
supported standard pin properties:

- drive-push-pull: Push-pull drive mode (default, not required). Only
  applies for GPIO_IN mode.
- drive-open-drain: Open-drain drive mode. Only applies for GPIO_IN mode.
- bias-disable: Disable pull-up/down (default, not required). Only applies
  for GPIO_IN mode.
- bias-pull-up: Enable pull-up resistor. Only applies for GPIO_IN mode.
- bias-pull-down: Enable pull-down resistor. Only applies for GPIO_IN mode.
- slew-rate: Set the maximum speed (and so the slew-rate) of the output
  signal (default: 2MHz). Only applies for ALTERNATE mode.

Note that drive and bias options are mutually exclusive.

Peripherals that are remappable will have their pre-defined macros suffixed
with the remap option being selected, for example:

  - CAN0_RX_PA11_NORMP: No remap
  - CAN0_RX_PB8_PRMP: Partial remap
  - CAN0_RX_PD0_FRMP: Full remap

It is important that **ALL** pinmux entries share the same remap. For
example:

  &pinctrl {
    can0_default: can0_default {
      group1 {
        pinmux = <CAN0_RX_PD0_FRMP>, <CAN0_TX_PD1_FRMP>;
        /*                    ^^^^                ^^^^           */
        /* CAN0 pins are remapped choosing the full remap option */
      };
    };
  };

To link pin configurations with a device, use a pinctrl-N property for some
number N, like this example you could place in your board's DTS file:

   #include "board-pinctrl.dtsi"

   &usart0 {
         pinctrl-0 = <&usart0_default>;
         pinctrl-1 = <&usart0_sleep>;
         pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
   };
```

### Top level properties

These property descriptions apply to “gd,gd32-pinctrl-afio”
nodes themselves. This page also describes child node
properties in the following sections.

Node specific propertiesDeprecated node specific propertiesBase properties

Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “gd,gd32-pinctrl-afio” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property. For example:    / {        soc {            #address-cells = <1>;            #size-cells = <1>;             uart@1000 {                reg = <0x1000 0x2000>, <0x3000 0x4000>;                reg-names = "foo", "bar";            };        };   };  The uart@1000 node has two register blocks:    - one with base address 0x1000, size 0x2000, and name "foo"   - another with base address 0x3000, size 0x4000, and name "bar" ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device. The interrupts themselves are defined in either "interrupts" or "interrupts-extended" properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text If present, this refers to the node which handles interrupts generated by this device.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.  For details, see "4.1.2 Miscellaneous Properties" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each clock provider in the "clocks" property. ``` |
