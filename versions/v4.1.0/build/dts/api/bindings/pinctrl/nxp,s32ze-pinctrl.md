# nxp,s32ze-pinctrl

Vendor: [NXP Semiconductors](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-nxp)

## Description

```text
NXP S32 pinctrl node for S32Z/E SoCs.

The NXP S32 pin controller is a singleton node responsible for controlling
the pin function selection and pin properties. This node, labeled 'pinctrl' in
the SoC's devicetree, will define pin configurations in pin groups. Each group
within the pin configuration defines the pin configuration for a peripheral,
and each numbered subgroup in the pin group defines all the pins for that
peripheral with the same configuration properties. The 'pinmux' property in
a group selects the pins to be configured, and the remaining properties set
configuration values for those pins.

For example, to configure the pinmux for UART0, modify the 'pinctrl' from your
board or application devicetree overlay as follows:

  /* Include the SoC package header containing the predefined pins definitions */
  #include <nxp/s32/S32Z27-BGA594-pinctrl.h>

  &pinctrl {
    uart0_default: uart0_default {
      group1 {
        pinmux = <PB10_LIN_0_TX>;
        output-enable;
      };
      group2 {
        pinmux = <PB11_LIN_0_RX>;
        input-enable;
      };
    };
  };

The 'uart0_default' node contains the pin configurations for a particular state
of a device. The 'default' state is the active state. Other states for the same
device can be specified in separate child nodes of 'pinctrl'.

In addition to 'pinmux' property, each group can contain other properties such as
'bias-pull-up' or 'slew-rate' that will be applied to all the pins defined in
'pinmux' array. To enable the input buffer use 'input-enable' and to enable the
output buffer use 'output-enable'.

To link the pin configurations with UART0 device, use pinctrl-N property in the
device node, where 'N' is the zero-based state index (0 is the default state).
Following previous example:

  &uart0 {
    pinctrl-0 = <&uart0_default>;
    pinctrl-names = "default";
    status = "okay";
  };

If only the required properties are supplied, the pin configuration register
will be assigned the following reset values:
  - input and output buffers disabled
  - internal pull not enabled
  - open drain disabled
  - slew rate 4 (see description in property below).
  - termination resistor disabled (affect LVDS pads only).
  - current reference control disabled (affect LVDS pads only).
  - Rx current boost disabled  (affect LVDS pads only).

Additionally:
- Safe Mode is always kept as reset value (disabled).
- Receiver Select is always kept as reset value (enables the differential vref based receiver).
```

### Top level properties

These property descriptions apply to “nxp,s32ze-pinctrl”
nodes themselves. This page also describes child node
properties in the following sections.

Node specific propertiesDeprecated node specific propertiesBase properties

Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “nxp,s32ze-pinctrl” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property. For example:    / {        soc {            #address-cells = <1>;            #size-cells = <1>;             uart@1000 {                reg = <0x1000 0x2000>, <0x3000 0x4000>;                reg-names = "foo", "bar";            };        };   };  The uart@1000 node has two register blocks:    - one with base address 0x1000, size 0x2000, and name "foo"   - another with base address 0x3000, size 0x4000, and name "bar" ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device. The interrupts themselves are defined in either "interrupts" or "interrupts-extended" properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |

| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.  For details, see "4.1.2 Miscellaneous Properties" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
