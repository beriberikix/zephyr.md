## Description

```text
Infineon CAT1 Pinctrl container node

This is a singleton node responsible for controlling the pin function selection
and pin properties. For example, you can use this node to route
UART0 RX to a particular port/pin and enable the pull-up resistor on that
pin.

The node has the 'pinctrl' node label set in SoC's devicetree,
so you can modify it like this:

&pinctrl {
    /* Your modifications go here */
};

Pin configuration can also specify the pin properties, for example the
'bias-pull-up' property. Here is a list of the supported standard pin
properties:
  * bias-high-impedance
  * bias-pull-up
  * bias-pull-down
  * drive-open-drain
  * drive-open-source
  * drive-push-pull   (strong)
  * input-enable      (input-buffer)

Infineon CAT1 SoC's devicetree includes a set of pre-defined pin control
Nodes, which can be found via MPN dtsi.
For example, board cy8cproto_062_4343w uses the CY8C624ABZI_S2D44 part, so
board dts (boards\arm\cy8cproto_062_4343w\cy8cproto_062_4343w.dts) includes MPN dts
(infineon/psoc6/mpns/CY8C624ABZI_S2D44.dtsi).

Each MPN dtsi includes package dtsi (../psoc6_xx/psoc6_xx.yyy-zzz.dtsi),
For example, CY8C624ABZI_S2D44 includes "../psoc6_02/psoc6_02.124-bga.dtsi".

An example of pre-defined pin control from package dtsi (e.g. psoc6_02.124-bga.dtsi):
p3_0_scb2_uart_rx - RX pin UART2 (SCB2) which connected to port3.0

  /omit-if-no-ref/ p3_0_scb2_uart_rx: p3_0_scb2_uart_rx {
        pinmux = <DT_CAT1_PINMUX(3, 0, HSIOM_SEL_ACT_6)>;
  };

Refer to psoc6_02.124-bga.dtsi for the list of all pre-defined pin control nodes.

NOTE1 Pre-defined pin control nodes use macro DT_CAT1_PINMUX to
  initialize pinmux. DT_CAT1_PINMUX has the following input parameters
  DT_CAT1_PINMUX(port_number, pin_number, hsiom),
  hsiom is defined in the HSIOM_SEL_xxx macros in the
  zephyr\include\zephyr\dt-bindings\pinctrl\ifx_cat1-pinctrl.h file.

      You can use DT_CAT1_PINMUX to define your own pin control node:
        &pinctrl {
            my_uart_rx: my_uart_rx {
                pinmux = <DT_CAT1_PINMUX(3, 0, HSIOM_SEL_ACT_6)>;
            };
        };

NOTE2 Pre-defined pin control nodes do not have bias pin configuration.
  The bias configuration can be updated in board-pinctrl.dtsi
  &pinctrl {
    /* Configure pin control Bias mode for uart2 pins */
    p3_1_scb2_uart_tx {
      drive-push-pull;
    };

    p3_0_scb2_uart_rx {
      input-enable;
    };

    p3_2_scb2_uart_rts {
      drive-push-pull;
    };

    p3_3_scb2_uart_cts {
      input-enable;
    };
  };

An example of the usage of pre-defined pin control nodes in your board's DTS file:

  &uart5 {
    pinctrl-0 = <&p5_1_scb5_uart_tx &p5_0_scb5_uart_rx>;
    pinctrl-names = "default";
  };

  /* Configure pin control bias mode for uart5 pins */
  &p5_1_scb5_uart_tx {
    drive-push-pull;
  };

  &p5_0_scb5_uart_rx {
    input-enable;
  };
```

## Properties

### Top level properties

These property descriptions apply to “infineon,cat1-pinctrl”
nodes themselves. This page also describes child node
properties in the following sections.

Node specific propertiesDeprecated node specific propertiesBase properties

Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “infineon,cat1-pinctrl” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property. For example:    / {        soc {            #address-cells = <1>;            #size-cells = <1>;             uart@1000 {                reg = <0x1000 0x2000>, <0x3000 0x4000>;                reg-names = "foo", "bar";            };        };   };  The uart@1000 node has two register blocks:    - one with base address 0x1000, size 0x2000, and name "foo"   - another with base address 0x3000, size 0x4000, and name "bar" ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device. The interrupts themselves are defined in either "interrupts" or "interrupts-extended" properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text If present, this refers to the node which handles interrupts generated by this device.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.  For details, see "4.1.2 Miscellaneous Properties" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each clock provider in the "clocks" property. ``` |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by address fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by size fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
