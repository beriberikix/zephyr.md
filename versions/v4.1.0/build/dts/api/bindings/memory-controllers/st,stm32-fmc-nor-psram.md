# st,stm32-fmc-nor-psram

Vendor: [STMicroelectronics](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-st)

Note

An implementation of a driver matching this compatible is available in
[drivers/memc/memc\_stm32\_nor\_psram.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/drivers/memc/memc_stm32_nor_psram.c).

## Description

```text
STM32 Flexible Memory Controller (NOR Flash/PSRAM/SRAM controller).

The FMC generates the appropriate signal timings to drive the
following types of memories:

* Asynchronous SRAM and ROM
  - 8 bits
  - 16 bits
  - 32 bits
* PSRAM (Cellular RAM)
  - Asynchronous mode
  - Burst mode for synchronous accesses with configurable option to split burst
    access when crossing boundary page for CRAM 1.5.
  - Multiplexed or non-multiplexed
* NOR Flash memory
  - Asynchronous mode
  - Burst mode for synchronous accesses
  - Multiplexed or non-multiplexed

A unique Chip Select signal (NE) is used per bank. All the other
signals (addresses, data and control) are shared. A wide range of
devices is supported through programmable timings.

Refer to the reference manual for more details.

The FMC NOR/PSRAM controller is defined below the FMC node and banks are
defined as child nodes of the FMC NOR/PSRAM controller node.

You can enable the controller in devicetree as follows:

&fmc {
  status = "okay";
  pinctrl-0 = <&fmc_nwe_pd5 &fmc_noe_pd4 ...>;
  pinctrl-names = "default";

  sram {
    status = "okay";
    compatible = "st,stm32-fmc-nor-psram";

    #address-cells = <1>;
    #size-cells = <0>;

    sram2@2 {
      reg = <0x2>;
      st,control = <STM32_FMC_DATA_ADDRESS_MUX_DISABLE
                    STM32_FMC_MEMORY_TYPE_SRAM
                    STM32_FMC_NORSRAM_MEM_BUS_WIDTH_16
                    STM32_FMC_BURST_ACCESS_MODE_DISABLE
                    STM32_FMC_WAIT_SIGNAL_POLARITY_LOW
                    STM32_FMC_WAIT_TIMING_BEFORE_WS
                    STM32_FMC_WRITE_OPERATION_ENABLE
                    STM32_FMC_WAIT_SIGNAL_DISABLE
                    STM32_FMC_EXTENDED_MODE_DISABLE
                    STM32_FMC_ASYNCHRONOUS_WAIT_DISABLE
                    STM32_FMC_WRITE_BURST_DISABLE
                    STM32_FMC_CONTINUOUS_CLOCK_SYNC_ONLY
                    STM32_FMC_WRITE_FIFO_DISABLE
                    STM32_FMC_PAGE_SIZE_NONE>;
      st,timing = <4 2 3 0 16 17 STM32_FMC_ACCESS_MODE_A>;
    };
  };

These property descriptions apply to “st,stm32-fmc-nor-psram”
nodes themselves. This page also describes child node
properties in the following sections.

Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “st,stm32-fmc-nor-psram” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by address fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  Constant value: `1` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by size fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property. For example:    / {        soc {            #address-cells = <1>;            #size-cells = <1>;             uart@1000 {                reg = <0x1000 0x2000>, <0x3000 0x4000>;                reg-names = "foo", "bar";            };        };   };  The uart@1000 node has two register blocks:    - one with base address 0x1000, size 0x2000, and name "foo"   - another with base address 0x3000, size 0x4000, and name "bar" ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device. The interrupts themselves are defined in either "interrupts" or "interrupts-extended" properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text If present, this refers to the node which handles interrupts generated by this device.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.  For details, see "4.1.2 Miscellaneous Properties" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each clock provider in the "clocks" property. ``` |

When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
| `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto` | `boolean` | ```text Automatically configure the device for runtime power management after the init function runs. ``` |
| `zephyr,disabling-power-states` | `phandles` | ```text List of power states that will disable this device power. ``` |
