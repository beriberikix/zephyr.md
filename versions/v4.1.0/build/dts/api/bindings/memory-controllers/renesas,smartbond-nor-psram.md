Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `is-ram` | `boolean` | ```text If present, the memory controller will be configured to drive PSRAM devices. ``` |
| `dev-size` | `int` | ```text Memory size/capacity in bits. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `dev-type` | `int` | ```text Device type, part of device ID, used to verify the memory device used. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `dev-density` | `int` | ```text Device density, part of device ID, used to verify the memory device used. [7:0] should reflect the density value itself and [15:8] should reflect the mask that should be applied to the returned device ID value. This is because part of its byte value might contain invalid bits. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `dev-id` | `int` | ```text Manufacturer ID, part of device ID, used to verify the memory device used. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `reset-delay-us` | `int` | ```text Time in microseconds (us) the memory device can accept the next command following a SW reset. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `read-cs-idle-min-ns` | `int` | ```text Min. time, in nanoseconds, the #CS line should remain inactive between the transmission of two different instructions. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `erase-cs-idle-min-ns` | `int` | ```text Min. time, in nanoseconds, the #CS line should remain inactive after the execution of a write enable, erase, erase suspend or erase resume instruction. This setting is not used if is-ram property is present. ``` |
| `enter-qpi-cmd` | `int` | ```text Command to enter the QPI mode supported by a memory device (should be transmitted in single bus mode). ``` |
| `exit-qpi-cmd` | `int` | ```text Command to exit the QPI mode supported by a memory device (should be transmitted in quad bus mode). ``` |
| `enter-qpi-mode` | `boolean` | ```text If present, the memory device will enter the QPI mode which typically reflects that all bytes be sent in quad bus mode. It's a pre-requisite that read and write commands, that should be read-cmd and write-cmd respectively, reflect the QPI mode. ``` |
| `read-cmd` | `int` | ```text Read command for single/burst read accesses in auto mode. Default value is the opcode for single mode which is supported by all memory devices. ```  Default value: `3` |
| `write-cmd` | `int` | ```text Write command for single/burst write accesses in auto mode. Default value is the opcode for single mode which is supported by all memory devices. ```  Default value: `2` |
| `clock-mode` | `string` | ```text Clock mode when #CS is idle/inactive  - Mode0: #CLK is low when #CS is inactive - Mode3: #CLK is high when #CS is inactive  Mode0 is selected by default as it should be supported by all memory devices. ```  Default value: `spi-mode0`  Legal values: `'spi-mode0'`, `'spi-mode3'` |
| `addr-range` | `string` | ```text Address size to use in auto mode. In 24-bit mode up to 16MB can be accessed whilst in 32-bit mode up to 32MB can be accessed which is the max. address space supported by QSPICx.

| `tcem-max-us` | `int` | ```text If a non zero value is applied, then Tcem should be taken into consideration by QSPIC2 so that it can split a burst read/write access in case the total time exceeds the defined value (at the cost of extra cycles required for re-sending the instruction, address and dummy bytes, if any). This setting is meaningful only if is-ram is present. This value reflects the max. time in microseconds the #CS line can be driven low in a write/read burst access (required for the auto-refresh mechanism, when supported). ``` |
| `dummy-bytes-count` | `string` | ```text Number of dummy bytes to send for single/burst read access in auto mode. ```  This property is **required**.  Legal values: `'dummy-bytes-count0'`, `'dummy-bytes-count1'`, `'dummy-bytes-count2'`, `'dummy-bytes-count4'` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “renesas,smartbond-nor-psram” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property.

| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |

| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.  For details, see "4.1.2 Miscellaneous Properties" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each clock provider in the "clocks" property. ``` |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by address fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by size fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
