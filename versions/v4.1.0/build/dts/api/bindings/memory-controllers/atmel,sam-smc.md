# atmel,sam-smc

Vendor: [Atmel Corporation](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-atmel)

Note

An implementation of a driver matching this compatible is available in
[drivers/memc/memc\_sam\_smc.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/drivers/memc/memc_sam_smc.c).

## Description

```text
Atmel Static Memory Controller (SMC).

The SMC allows to interface with static-memory mapped external devices such as
SRAM, PSRAM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, LCD Module, NOR Flash and NAND Flash.

The SMC is clocked through the Master Clock (MCK) which is controlled by the
Power Management Controller (PMC).

The SMC controller can have up to 4 children defining the connected external
memory devices. The reg property is set to the device's Chip Select.
Device Tree example taken from the sam4_xplained board:

&smc {
  status = "okay";
  pinctrl-0 = <&smc_default>;
  pinctrl-names = "default";

  is66wv51216dbll@0 {
    reg = <0>;

    atmel,smc-write-mode = "nwe";
    atmel,smc-read-mode = "nrd";
    atmel,smc-setup-timing = <1 1 1 1>;
    atmel,smc-pulse-timing = <6 6 6 6>;
    atmel,smc-cycle-timing = <7 7>;
  };
};

The above example configures a is66wv51216dbll-55 device. The device is a
low power static RAM which uses NWE and NRD signals connected to the WE
and OE inputs respectively. Assuming that MCK is 120MHz (cpu at full speed)
each MCK cycle will be equivalent to 8ns. Since the memory full cycle is
55ns, as per specification, it requires atmel,smc-cycle-timing of at least
7 pulses (56ns). The atmel,smc-cycle-timing is composed of three parts:
setup, pulse and hold. The setup is used to address the memory. The pulse
is the time used to read/write. The hold is used to release memory. For the
is66wv51216dbll-55 a minimum setup of 5ns (1 cycle) with at least 45ns
(6 cycles) for CPU read/write and no hold time is required.
Note: Since no hold parameter is available at SMC the atmel,smc-cycle-timing
should have additional cycles to accommodate for hold values.

  No Hold Time:
  cycle-timing (7) = setup (1) + pulse (6) + hold (0)

  With 3 Hold Times:
  cycle-timing (10) = setup (1) + pulse (6) + hold (3)

Finally, in order to make the memory available you will need to define new
memory device/s in DeviceTree:

sram1: sram@60000000 {
    compatible = "zephyr,memory-region", "mmio-sram";
    device_type = "memory";
    reg = <0x60000000 DT_SIZE_K(512)>;
    zephyr,memory-region = "SRAM1";
};
```

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “atmel,sam-smc” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ```  This property is **required**. |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by address fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  Constant value: `1` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by size fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents.

The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.
