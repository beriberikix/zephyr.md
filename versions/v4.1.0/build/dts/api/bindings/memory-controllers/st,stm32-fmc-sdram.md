# st,stm32-fmc-sdram

Vendor: [STMicroelectronics](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-st)

Note

An implementation of a driver matching this compatible is available in
[drivers/memc/memc\_stm32\_sdram.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/drivers/memc/memc_stm32_sdram.c).

## Description

```text
STM32 Flexible Memory Controller (SDRAM controller).

The FMC SDRAM controller can be used to interface with external SDRAM
memories. Up to 2 SDRAM banks are supported with independent configuration. It
is worth to note that while settings are independent, some are shared or are
required to be set according to the most constraining device. Refer to the
properties description or the datasheet for more details.

The FMC SDRAM controller is defined below the FMC node and SDRAM banks are
defined as child nodes of the FMC SDRAM node. You can either have bank 1 (@0),
bank 2 (@1) or both. You can enable the FMC SDRAM controller in your board
DeviceTree file like this:

&fmc {
    status = "okay";
    pinctrl-0 = <&fmc_nbl0_pe0 &fmc_nbl1_pe1 &fmc_nbl2_pi4...>;

    sdram {
        status = "okay";

        power-up-delay = <100>;
        num-auto-refresh = <8>;
        mode-register = <0x220>;
        refresh-rate = <603>;

        bank@0 {
            reg = <0>;

            st,sdram-control = <STM32_FMC_SDRAM_NC_9
                                STM32_FMC_SDRAM_NR_12
                                STM32_FMC_SDRAM_MWID_32
                                STM32_FMC_SDRAM_NB_4
                                STM32_FMC_SDRAM_CAS_2
                                STM32_FMC_SDRAM_SDCLK_PERIOD_2
                                STM32_FMC_SDRAM_RBURST_ENABLE
                                STM32_FMC_SDRAM_RPIPE_0>;
            st,sdram-timing = <2 6 4 6 2 2 2>;
        };

        bank@1 {
            reg = <1>;
            ...
        };
    };
};

Note that you will find definitions for the st,sdram-control field at
dt-bindings/memory-controller/stm32-fmc-sdram.h. This file is already included
in the SoC DeviceTree files.

Finally, in order to make the memory available you will need to define new
memory device/s in DeviceTree:

sdram1: sdram@c0000000 {
    compatible = "zephyr,memory-region", "mmio-sram";
    device_type = "memory";
    reg = <0xc0000000 DT_SIZE_M(X)>;
    zephyr,memory-region = "SDRAM1";
};

sdram2: sdram@d0000000 {
    compatible = "zephyr,memory-region", "mmio-sram";
    device_type = "memory";
    reg = <0xd0000000 DT_SIZE_M(X)>;
    zephyr,memory-region = "SDRAM2";
};

It is important to use sdram1 and sdram2 node labels for bank 1 and bank 2
respectively. Memory addresses are 0xc0000000 and 0xd0000000 for bank 1 and
bank 2 respectively.
```

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “st,stm32-fmc-sdram” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by address fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  Constant value: `1` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by size fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property. For example:    / {        soc {            #address-cells = <1>;            #size-cells = <1>;             uart@1000 {                reg = <0x1000 0x2000>, <0x3000 0x4000>;                reg-names = "foo", "bar";            };        };   };  The uart@1000 node has two register blocks:    - one with base address 0x1000, size 0x2000, and name "foo"   - another with base address 0x3000, size 0x4000, and name "bar" ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |

| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device. The interrupts themselves are defined in either "interrupts" or "interrupts-extended" properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text If present, this refers to the node which handles interrupts generated by this device.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.  For details, see "4.1.2 Miscellaneous Properties" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |

When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
| `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto` | `boolean` | ```text Automatically configure the device for runtime power management after the init function runs. ``` |
| `zephyr,disabling-power-states` | `phandles` | ```text List of power states that will disable this device power. ``` |
