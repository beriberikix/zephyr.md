# espressif,esp32-ledc

Vendor: [Espressif Systems](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-espressif)

Note

An implementation of a driver matching this compatible is available in
[drivers/pwm/pwm\_led\_esp32.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/drivers/pwm/pwm_led_esp32.c).

## Description

```text
ESP32 LED Control (LEDC)

The LEDC controller is primarily designed to control the intensity of LEDs, although it can be
used to generate PWM signals for other purposes as well.

The mapping between the channel and GPIO is done through pinctrl

  &ledc0 {
    pinctrl-0 = <&ledc0_default>;
    pinctrl-names = "default";
  }

The 'ledc0_default' node state is defined in <board>-pinctrl.dtsi.

  ledc0_default: ledc0_default {
          group1 {
                  pinmux = <LEDC_CH0_GPIO0>,
                           <LEDC_CH1_GPIO2>,
                           <LEDC_CH2_GPIO4>;
                  output-enable;
          };
  };

If another GPIO mapping is desired, check if <board>-pinctrl.dtsi already have it defined,
otherwise, define the required mapping at your own application folder into a custom
<board>.overlay file.
The 'pinmux' property uses a macro defined in
https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/hal_espressif/tree/zephyr/include/dt-bindings/pinctrl
Before including a new node, check if the desired mapping is available according to the SoC.

As an example, the 'ledc0_custom' state below illustrates an alternate mapping using another set
of channels and pins in a custom overlay file.

  &pinctrl {

          ledc0_custom:  ledc0_custom {
                  group1 {
                          pinmux = <LEDC_CH0_GPIO0>,
                                   <LEDC_CH9_GPIO2>,
                                   <LEDC_CH10_GPIO4>;
                          output-enable;
                  };
           };

  };

Use the child bindings to configure the desired channel:

  &ledc0 {
    pinctrl-0 = <&ledc0_custom>;
    pinctrl-names = "default";
    status = "okay";
    #address-cells = <1>;
    #size-cells = <0>;
    channel0@0 {
      reg = <0x0>;
      timer = <0>;
    };
    channel9@9 {
      reg = <0x9>;
      timer = <0>;
      inverted;
    };
    channel10@a {
      reg = <0xa>;
      timer = <1>;
    };
  };

  For the channel to be initially inverted after the driver's init, the flag 'inverted' can
  be declared, as shown above for channel 9.

  Note: The channel's 'reg' property defines the ID of the channel. It must match the channel used
    in the 'pinmux'.
```

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “espressif,esp32-ledc” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property.

| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device. The interrupts themselves are defined in either "interrupts" or "interrupts-extended" properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text If present, this refers to the node which handles interrupts generated by this device.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.  For details, see "4.1.2 Miscellaneous Properties" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
