## Description

```text
Infineon XMC4XXX PWM Capture Compare Unit 8 (CCU8) module

The PWM CCU8 module can automatically generate a high-side
and a low-side PWM signal, where the two signals are complementary
to each other.

The module supports adding a dead time between the high-side and
low-side PWM signals.

The dead time ensures that there is a delay before the PWM state
transitions from 0 to 1, preventing the high-side and low-side
switches from being on simultaneously.

There are two CCU8 modules with DTS node labels: pwm_ccu80 and
pwm_ccu81. Each module has four slices, and each slice has
two channels. A channel consists of a corresponding high-side
and low-side PWM signal.

The CCU8 modules use the CCU clock source. Each slice applies
a separate prescaler to divide the clock. The clock divider is
defined by the 'slice-prescaler' property. Additionally, each
slice has a dead time prescaler, which divides the slice clock
for the dead time counter.

Device tree example:
A node can define a 'pwm' field, usually referenced in a 'pwms'
property, where the entries include the PWM module phandle,
channel number, pulse period (in nanoseconds or set using
PWM_XX() macros), and a channel
flag (PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL/PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED).

The 'pwm_ccu8' node must define the following fields:
&pwm_ccu80 {
        slice-prescaler = <15 15 15 15>;
        slice-deadtime-prescaler = <3 3 3 3>;
        channel-deadtime-high = <0 0 0 0 PWM_MSEC(100) 0 0 0>;
        channel-deadtime-low = <0 0 0 0 PWM_MSEC(100) 0 0 0>;
        pinctrl-0 = <&pwm_out_p5_9_ccu80_ch4_high &pwm_out_p0_0_ccu80_ch4_low>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
};

This will configure channel 4 with a 100msec deadtime on the high
and low side PWM signals.

Another node can reference the PWM as follows:
&test_node {
   ...
   pwms = <&pwm_ccu80 0 PWM_SEC(1) PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL>;
   ...
};

The 'pwm_out_p{PORT}_{PIN}_ccu8{MODULE_IDX}_ch{CHANNEL_IDX}_{HIGH_LOW}'
format is used for CCU8 pinctrl nodes. 'MODULE_IDX' and 'CHANNEL_IDX'
refer to a specific 'pwm_ccu8x' module and channel, respectively.
'PORT/PIN' defines the GPIO that the channel connects to.
'HIGH_LOW' indicates whether the pin is for the high or low-side signal.

It's not necessary to specify both the high and low pinctrls. Only the low-side
signal can, for example, be used as PWM, but note that the duty cycle of the
low signal will be (1 - duty) as set via the API.

Note that a slice has two channels. Channels 0/1 are in slice 0,
channels 2/3 are in slice 1, and so on. Each channel can have its own
duty cycle and high/low dead times. But the pulse duration applies to
both channels. Thus, when using the PWM control api to modify the pulse width
on a channel 0, it will also be updated for channel 1 since they are
in the same slice.

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “infineon,xmc4xxx-ccu8-pwm” compatible.

| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |

The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
