# nxp,s32-emios-pwm

Vendor: [NXP Semiconductors](../../bindings.md#dt-vendor-nxp)

Note

An implementation of a driver matching this compatible is available in
[drivers/pwm/pwm\_nxp\_s32\_emios.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/drivers/pwm/pwm_nxp_s32_emios.c).

## Description

```text
NXP S32 eMIOS PWM node for S32 SoCs. Each channel in eMIOS can be configured
to use for PWM operation. There are several PWM modes supported by this module,
some modes only support on channels that have internal counter, some modes
require to use a reference timebase from a master bus.

For example to configuring eMIOS instance 0 with:
  - Channel 0 for mode OPWFMB
  - Channel 1 for mode OPWMB
  - Channel 2 for mode OPWMCB with deadtime inserted at leading edge
  - Channel 3 for mode SAIC, use internal timebase with input filter = 2 eMIOS clock

  emios0_pwm: pwm {
    pwm_0 {
      channel = <0>;
      pwm-mode = "OPWFMB";
      prescaler = <8>;
    };

    pwm_1 {
      channel = <1>;
      master-bus = <&emios1_bus_a>;
      pwm-mode = "OPWMB";
      phase-shift = <100>;
    };

    pwm_2 {
      channel = <2>;
      master-bus = <&emios1_bus_b>;
      pwm-mode = "OPWMCB_LEAD_EDGE";
      dead-time = <100>;
    };

    pwm_3 {
      channel = <3>;
      pwm-mode = "SAIC";
      prescaler = <8>;
      input-filter = <2>;
    };
  };

OPWMB and OPWMCB modes use reference timebase, the master bus is chosen over
phandle 'master-bus'. Please notice that the devicetree node for master bus
should be enabled and configured for using, please see 'nxp,s32-emios' bindings.

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “nxp,s32-emios-pwm” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property.

| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device. The interrupts themselves are defined in either "interrupts" or "interrupts-extended" properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |

| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.  For details, see "4.1.2 Miscellaneous Properties" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |

| --- | --- | --- |
| `channel` | `int` | ```text eMIOS PWM channel ```  This property is **required**. |
| `master-bus` | `phandle` | ```text A phandle to master-bus node that will be used as external timebase for current channel, this can be bypassed if internal counter is used for PWM operation.

The period is determined by period of           an external counter driven in MCB Up Mode. Changing PWM period           at runtime will impact to all channels share the same timebase.           The new period and cycle take effect in next period boundary.  - OPWMCB: generates a center aligned PWM with dead time insertion to the           leading or trailing edge. The period is determined by period of           an external counter driven in MCB Up Down Mode. Changing PWM period           at runtime will impact to all channels share the same timebase,           The new period and cycle take effect in next period boundary.  - SAIC: single action input capture mode, the eMIOS captures events as soon as         they occur.
