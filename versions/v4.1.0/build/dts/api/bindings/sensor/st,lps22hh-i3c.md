| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assigned-address` | `int` | ```text Dynamic address to be assigned to the device. ``` |
| `supports-setaasa` | `boolean` | ```text Indicates if the device supports the CCC SETAASA. If true, it will be used as an optimization for bus initialization. ``` |
| `supply-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text GPIO specifier that controls power to the device.  This property should be provided when the device has a dedicated switch that controls power to the device.  The supply state is entirely the responsibility of the device driver.  Contrast with vin-supply. ``` |
| `vin-supply` | `phandle` | ```text Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device. The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.  This property should be provided when device power is supplied by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the request status of all devices fed by the regulator.  Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an inactive state before releasing the regulator. ``` |
| `drdy-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text DRDY pin  This pin defaults to active high when produced by the sensor. The property value should ensure the flags properly describe the signal that is presented to the driver. ``` |
| `odr` | `int` | ```text Specify the default output data rate expressed in samples per second (Hz). The default is the power-on reset value.  - 0  # LPS22HH_DT_ODR_POWER_DOWN - 1  # LPS22HH_DT_ODR_1HZ - 2  # LPS22HH_DT_ODR_10HZ - 3  # LPS22HH_DT_ODR_25HZ - 4  # LPS22HH_DT_ODR_50HZ - 5  # LPS22HH_DT_ODR_75HZ - 6  # LPS22HH_DT_ODR_100HZ - 7  # LPS22HH_DT_ODR_200HZ ```  Legal values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7` |
| `friendly-name` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the sensor. It can be used to distinguish multiple instances of the same model (e.g., lid accelerometer vs. base accelerometer in a laptop) to a host operating system.  This property is defined in the Generic Sensor Property Usages of the HID Usage Tables specification (https://usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_3_0.pdf, section 22.5). ``` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “st,lps22hh” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Contains 3 fields.  For I3C devices, the 3 fields are static address, first half of Provisioned ID, and the second half of the Provisioned ID.   1. The static address can be assigned to be the target device's      dynamic address before Dynamic Address Assignment (DAA)      starts. Can be zero if static address is not used, and      target address is determined via DAA.   2. First half of the Provisioned ID contains the manufacturer      ID left-shifted by 1, where the manufacturer ID is      the bits 33-47 (zero-based) of the 48-bit Provisioned ID.   3. Second half of the Provisioned ID contains the combination of      the part ID (bits 16-31 of the Provisioned ID) left-shifted      by 16, and the instance ID (bits 12-15 of the Provisioned ID)      left-shifted by 12. Basically, this is the lower 32 bits      of the Provisioned ID.  Note that the DT node of a I3C target device should be in format "<node name>@<address + PID>", e.g. "sensor@4200001234012345678", where the PID part is expanded to be a 64-bit integer.  For I2C devices, the 3 fields are static address, 0x00, and value of the Legacy Virtual Register (LVR).    1. 7-bit address of the I2C device. (Note that 10-bit       addressing is not supported.)    2. Always 0x00.    3. LVR describes the I2C device where,       * bit[31:8]: unused.       * bit[7:5]: I2C device index:           * Index 0: I2C device has a 50 ns spike filter where                      it is not affected by high frequency on SCL.           * Index 1: I2C device does not have a 50 ns spike filter                      but can work with high frequency on SCL.           * Index 2: I2C device does not have a 50 ns spike filter                      and cannot work with high frequency on SCL.           * Other values are reserved.       * bit[4]: I2C mode indicator:           * 0: FM+ mode           * 1: FM mode       * bit[3:0]: reserved.  The DT node of a I2C device should be in format "<node name>@<address + 00000000 + LVR>", e.g. "sensor@5000000000000000FF", where the middle 0x00 and LVR are both expanded to 32-bit integers. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property. For example:    / {        soc {            #address-cells = <1>;            #size-cells = <1>;             uart@1000 {                reg = <0x1000 0x2000>, <0x3000 0x4000>;                reg-names = "foo", "bar";            };        };   };  The uart@1000 node has two register blocks:    - one with base address 0x1000, size 0x2000, and name "foo"   - another with base address 0x3000, size 0x4000, and name "bar" ``` |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device.

| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.  For details, see "4.1.2 Miscellaneous Properties" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each clock provider in the "clocks" property. ``` |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by address fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by size fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |

| `zephyr,deferred-init` | `boolean` | ```text Do not initialize device automatically on boot. Device should be manually initialized using device_init(). ``` |
| `wakeup-source` | `boolean` | ```text Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.  When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.  Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary. ``` |
