| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `anomaly-58-workaround` | `boolean` | ```text Enables the workaround for the nRF52832 SoC SPIM PAN 58 anomaly. Must be used in conjunction with CONFIG_SOC_NRF52832_ALLOW_SPIM_DESPITE_PAN_58=y ``` |
| `rx-delay-supported` | `boolean` | ```text Indicates if the SPIM instance has the capability of delaying MISO sampling. This property needs to be defined at SoC level DTS files. ``` |
| `rx-delay` | `int` | ```text Number of 64 MHz clock cycles (15.625 ns) delay from the sampling edge of SCK (leading or trailing, depending on the CPHA setting used) until the input serial data on MISO is actually sampled. This property does not have any effect if the rx-delay-supported property is not set. ```  Legal values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7` |
| `pinctrl-0` | `phandles` | ```text Pin configuration/s for the first state. Content is specific to the selected pin controller driver implementation. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `pinctrl-names` | `string-array` | ```text Names for the provided states. The number of names needs to match the number of states. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `max-frequency` | `int` | ```text Maximum data rate the SPI peripheral can be driven at, in Hz. This property must be set at SoC level DTS files. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `overrun-character` | `int` | ```text Configurable, defaults to 0xff (line high), the most common value used in SPI transfers. ```  Default value: `255` |
| `easydma-maxcnt-bits` | `int` | ```text Maximum number of bits available in the EasyDMA MAXCNT register. This property must be set at SoC level DTS files. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `wake-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text Optional bi-directional line that allows SPI master to indicate to SPI slave (by setting the line high) that a transfer is to occur, so that the latter can prepare (and indicate its readiness) for handling that transfer when it is actually needed, and stay in any desired low-power state otherwise. The protocol is as follows: - initially, SPI slave configures its WAKE line pin as an input and SPI   master keeps the line in the low state - when a transfer is to be performed, SPI master configures its WAKE   line pin as an input with pull-up; this changes the line state to   high but allows SPI slave to override that state - when SPI slave detects the high state of the WAKE line, it prepares   for the transfer and when everything is ready, it drives the WAKE   line low by configuring its pin as an output - the generated high-to-low transition on the WAKE line is a signal   to SPI master that it can proceed with the transfer - SPI slave releases the line by configuring its pin back to be an input   and SPI master again keeps the line in the low state Please note that the line must be configured and properly handled on both sides for the mechanism to work correctly. ``` |
| `clock-frequency` | `int` | ```text Clock frequency the SPI peripheral is being driven at, in Hz. ``` |
| `cs-gpios` | `phandle-array` | ```text An array of chip select GPIOs to use. Each element in the array specifies a GPIO. The index in the array corresponds to the child node that the CS gpio controls.  Example:    spi@... {           cs-gpios = <&gpio0 23 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>,                         <&gpio1 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>,                         ...;            spi-device@0 {                   reg = <0>;                   ...           };           spi-device@1 {                   reg = <1>;                   ...           };           ...   };  The child node "spi-device@0" specifies a SPI device with chip select controller gpio0, pin 23, and devicetree GPIO flags GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW. Similarly, "spi-device@1" has CS GPIO controller gpio1, pin 10, and flags GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW. Additional devices can be configured in the same way.  If unsure about the flags cell, GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW is generally a safe choice for a typical "CSn" pin. GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH may be used if intervening hardware inverts the signal to the peripheral device or the line itself is active high.  If this property is not defined, no chip select GPIOs are set. SPI controllers with dedicated CS pins do not need to define the cs-gpios property. ``` |
| `pinctrl-1` | `phandles` | ```text Pin configuration/s for the second state. See pinctrl-0. ``` |
| `pinctrl-2` | `phandles` | ```text Pin configuration/s for the third state. See pinctrl-0. ``` |
| `pinctrl-3` | `phandles` | ```text Pin configuration/s for the fourth state. See pinctrl-0. ``` |
| `pinctrl-4` | `phandles` | ```text Pin configuration/s for the fifth state. See pinctrl-0. ``` |
| `nordic,clockpin-enable` | `array` | ```text List of signals that require CLOCKPIN setting enablement. ``` |
| `memory-regions` | `phandle-array` | ```text List of memory region phandles ``` |
| `memory-region-names` | `string-array` | ```text A list of names, one for each corresponding phandle in memory-region ``` |

Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

(None)

Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
may apply to the “nordic,nrf-spim” compatible.

| Name | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reg` | `array` | ```text Information used to address the device. The value is specific to the device (i.e. is different depending on the compatible property).  The "reg" property is typically a sequence of (address, length) pairs. Each pair is called a "register block". Values are conventionally written in hex.  For details, see "2.3.6 reg" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `interrupts` | `array` | ```text Information about interrupts generated by the device, encoded as an array of one or more interrupt specifiers. The format of the data in this property varies by where the device appears in the interrupt tree. Devices with the same "interrupt-parent" will use the same format in their interrupts properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `#address-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by address fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  Constant value: `1` |
| `#size-cells` | `int` | ```text This property encodes the number of <u32> cells used by size fields in "reg" properties in this node's children.  For details, see "2.3.5 #address-cells and #size-cells" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**. |
| `status` | `string` | ```text Indicates the operational status of the hardware or other resource that the node represents. In particular:    - "okay" means the resource is operational and, for example,     can be used by device drivers   - "disabled" means the resource is not operational and the system     should treat it as if it is not present  For details, see "2.3.4 status" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  Legal values: `'ok'`, `'okay'`, `'disabled'`, `'reserved'`, `'fail'`, `'fail-sss'`  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `compatible` | `string-array` | ```text This property is a list of strings that essentially define what type of hardware or other resource this devicetree node represents. Each device driver checks for specific compatible property values to find the devicetree nodes that represent resources that the driver should manage.  The recommended format is "vendor,device", The "vendor" part is an abbreviated name of the vendor. The "device" is usually from the datasheet.  The compatible property can have multiple values, ordered from most- to least-specific. Having additional values is useful when the device is a specific instance of a more general family, to allow the system to match the most specific driver available.  For details, see "2.3.1 compatible" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ```  This property is **required**.  See [Important properties](../../../intro-syntax-structure.md#dt-important-props) for more information. |
| `reg-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each register block in the "reg" property. For example:    / {        soc {            #address-cells = <1>;            #size-cells = <1>;             uart@1000 {                reg = <0x1000 0x2000>, <0x3000 0x4000>;                reg-names = "foo", "bar";            };        };   };  The uart@1000 node has two register blocks:    - one with base address 0x1000, size 0x2000, and name "foo"   - another with base address 0x3000, size 0x4000, and name "bar" ``` |
| `interrupts-extended` | `compound` | ```text Extended interrupt specifier for device, used as an alternative to the "interrupts" property.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each interrupt generated by a device. The interrupts themselves are defined in either "interrupts" or "interrupts-extended" properties.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `interrupt-parent` | `phandle` | ```text If present, this refers to the node which handles interrupts generated by this device.  For details, see "2.4 Interrupts and Interrupt Mapping" in Devicetree Specification v0.4. ``` |
| `label` | `string` | ```text Human readable string describing the device. Use of this property is deprecated except as needed on a case-by-case basis.

| `clocks` | `phandle-array` | ```text Information about the device's clock providers. In general, this property should follow conventions established in the dt-schema binding:    https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml ``` |
| `clock-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to each clock provider in the "clocks" property. ``` |
| `dmas` | `phandle-array` | ```text DMA channel specifiers relevant to the device. ``` |
| `dma-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to the DMA channel specifiers in the "dmas" property. ``` |
| `io-channels` | `phandle-array` | ```text IO channel specifiers relevant to the device. ``` |
| `io-channel-names` | `string-array` | ```text Optional names given to the IO channel specifiers in the "io-channels" property. ``` |
